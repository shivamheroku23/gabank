## TOPIC 1: Payments Regulatory Board (PRB) – First Meeting

### What happened?

- On **5 January 2026**, in Mumbai, the **Payments Regulatory Board (PRB)**  
  held its **first formal meeting** (as per RBI releases/financial press reports).  
- Formation of PRB:  
  - After amendments to the **Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007** (effective 9 May 2025),  
  - the old **BPSS (Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems)** was replaced.  
- Chairperson: **RBI Governor (Sanjay Malhotra)**.  
- Members include:  
  - RBI Deputy Governor (Payments),  
  - RBI Executive Director (DPSS),  
  - three external members (Government nominees),  
  - representatives from MeitY, DFS, etc.

### Key points of the meeting

- Review of the **Department of Payment &amp; Settlement Systems (DPSS)** functions.  
- Discussion on domestic and global payment‑system challenges.  
- Deliberation on the draft **Payments Vision 2028**.  
- Presentation on findings from RBI’s **Survey on Digital Payments**.

### Why important for bank exams?

- PRB is now the **primary regulator/supervisor of India’s payment systems** –  
  covering UPI, cards, NEFT/RTGS, PPIs, etc.  
- MCQ hooks:  
  - Which Act? → **Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (amended)**.  
  - Which body was replaced? → **BPSS**.  
  - Who chairs PRB? → **RBI Governor**.

### Memory Trick – “PRB = Payments Rules Board”

> Think of PRB as the **Payments Rules Board** –  
> the board that sets and supervises the rules for all major payment systems.

## TOPIC 2: Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) – Rabi 2025‑26

### What happened?

- The government approved **Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)** rates  
  for **Phosphatic &amp; Potassic (P&amp;K) fertilisers** for the **Rabi 2025‑26 season (Oct 2025–Mar 2026)**.  
- Per‑kg nutrient subsidy (approx, exam‑relevant):  
  - Nitrogen (N): **₹43.02**  
  - Phosphorus (P): **₹47.96**  
  - Potassium (K): **₹2.38**  
  - Sulphur (S): **₹2.87**  
- Estimated subsidy bill (Rabi 2025‑26): about **₹37,952 crore**,  
  roughly **₹736 crore** higher than Kharif 2025.

### Bank/economy angle

- A large part of fertiliser subsidy flows **through banks** to companies/co‑operatives.  
- Such a big subsidy bill directly links to **fiscal deficit** and indirectly to **inflation**.

### Memory Trick – “NBS = NPKS RATE card”

> NBS = Nutrient Based Subsidy = the government’s **RATE card for N‑P‑K‑S** –  
> how many rupees per kg of each nutrient will be supported.

## TOPIC 3: ONGC–NSTFDC MoU – Tribal Education (EMRS)

### What happened?

- **ONGC** signed a **CSR MoU** with the  
  **National Scheduled Tribes Finance &amp; Development Corporation (NSTFDC)**:  
  - about **₹28 crore** CSR funds,  
  - to develop infrastructure and digital facilities in **Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)**.  
- Coverage:  
  - around **144 EMRS schools** in **11 States/UTs**,  
  - benefiting about **35,000 tribal students** indirectly.

### Why important for bank exams?

- Shows how **PSU CSR funds** are being channelled into **inclusive education and human capital**.  
- Better‑educated tribal youth can become **future MSME borrowers, SHG members and skilled workforce**,  
  expanding banks’ potential customer base.

### Memory Trick – “ONGC’s oil, EMRS education”

> Line: **“ONGC’s oil, EMRS ka school – NSTFDC ke through tribal education cool.”**

---

## TOPIC 4: NITI Aayog – Trade Deficit with FTA Partners

### What happened?

- As per NITI Aayog’s **Trade Watch report**,  
  in the **April–June 2025 quarter**, India’s **trade deficit with FTA partner countries**  
  increased by about **59% year‑on‑year**.  
- Reason: imports (especially in electronics, chemicals, intermediates)  
  grew faster than exports.

### Bank/economy angle

- A rising trade deficit → higher **Current Account Deficit (CAD)** →  
  pressures the rupee, interest rates and bond yields.  
- Useful for conceptual questions around FTAs and external sector risks.

### Memory Trick – “FTA = Free Trade, but Deficit walks in too”

> Line: **“FTA opens the gate, imports run faster – deficit walks in after.”**

---

## TOPIC 5: Payments Vision 2028 – Future of Digital Payments

### What happened?

- RBI’s draft **Payments Vision 2028** sets the direction  
  for India’s digital payments ecosystem up to 2028:  
  - make payments **Safe, Secure, Smart, Swift**,  
  - scale up UPI, RuPay, NEFT/RTGS, IMPS, BBPS,  
  - strengthen **fraud management and cyber‑security**,  
  - enable offline/feature‑phone payment solutions,  
  - improve cross‑border remittances (cheaper and faster).

### Why important for bank exams?

- UPI, RuPay, NEFT/RTGS, digital rupee, etc. –  
  their future roadmap ties back to Payments Vision 2028.  

### Memory Trick – “4S = Safe, Secure, Smart, Swift”

> Payments Vision 2028 = **4S** –  
> **Safe, Secure, Smart, Swift** digital payments.
