## TOPIC 1: December 2025 WPI Inflation – Back to +0.83%

### What happened?

- The **Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry (DPIIT)** released data showing that **Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation for December 2025** stood at **+0.83% year‑on‑year**.  
- In October and November 2025, WPI had been in **negative territory (deflation)**; December marks a shift back to positive wholesale inflation.  
- The uptick was driven mainly by **manufactured products, food products and textiles**, while the WPI Food Index’s annual change hovered around **0%**.  
- On a month‑on‑month basis, WPI rose by about **0.7%**, signalling renewed input‑cost pressures for producers.  
- At the retail level, **CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation** for December 2025 was around **1.3%**, still below RBI’s 4% target but pointing to an emerging upward trend.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Prelims can ask directly: **What was India’s WPI inflation in December 2025? Did it move from deflation to positive territory?**  
- For mains/interviews, this is a neat example to explain **WPI vs CPI** – WPI captures producer/wholesale prices, while CPI captures household retail prices.  
- In monetary policy answers, you can use this to show how **rising input costs (WPI)** can later feed into **consumer inflation (CPI)** and influence RBI’s rate decisions.

### Memory Trick – “0.83 – WPI climbed back on the tree”

> Think: **“0 point 8‑3 – WPI climbed back on the tree”** → 0.83% means WPI moved up from deflation into positive.

## TOPIC 2: Growth Outlook – FAE at 7.4%, World Bank GEP Puts India at 7.2%

### What happened?

- The **Ministry of Statistics &amp; Programme Implementation (MoSPI)** released the **First Advance Estimates (FAE) of National Income for FY 2025-26**:  
  - Real GDP growth is estimated at around **7.4%**.  
  - Real GVA growth is about **7.3%**, with **manufacturing and services** as key drivers.  
- The **World Bank’s “Global Economic Prospects – January 2026”** report projects India’s growth for FY 2025-26 at about **7.2%**, while global growth for 2026 is only around **2.6%**.  
- The report highlights India as **the fastest‑growing major economy**, supported by strong domestic demand, investment, and structural reforms.  
- These estimates dominated economic coverage in early January and form a key part of 14 January current affairs for exams.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Prelims often have questions like: **According to FAE, what is India’s estimated real GDP growth for FY 2025-26 (approximate range)?**  
- Forecasts of institutions like **World Bank/IMF/ADB/RBI** are regular features in Banking GA – you should know **which institution projected what** for India.  
- In mains/interviews, this serves as evidence that **India remains a “bright spot” amid global slowdown**, which you can use in economy‑related answers.

### Memory Trick – “Family of 7: 7.4 (FAE), 7.2 (World Bank)”

> Code it as: **“FAE four, Bank two – both in the 7‑plus crew”** → FAE ≈ 7.4%, World Bank ≈ 7.2%.

## TOPIC 3: RBI Discussion Paper – New Licensing Window for Urban Co‑operative Banks

### What happened?

- On **13 January 2026**, the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** released a **Discussion Paper (DP)** proposing to **re‑open licensing for Urban Co‑operative Banks (UCBs)**.  
- The focus is on granting licences mainly to **large, multi‑state co‑operative credit societies** that are already operating at scale.  
- Key proposed eligibility norms (indicative):  
  - Minimum **paid‑up capital of about ₹300 crore**.  
  - At least **10 years of operational track record**.  
  - **CRAR of at least 12%** and **Net NPA below around 3%**.  
- RBI has invited comments from stakeholders up to around **13 February 2026**, after which final guidelines may be issued.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- This links **co‑operative banking, financial inclusion and regulation** in one topic.  
- Objective questions can ask: **RBI’s latest Discussion Paper on licensing relates to which type of banks? (Urban Co‑operative Banks)** or conceptual questions on **capital / NPA / CRAR conditions**.  
- In mains/interviews, this is a fresh example of RBI moving towards a **“fewer but stronger” UCB sector** with higher capital and governance standards.

### Memory Trick – “Rule of 3: 300 capital, 10 years, 3% NPA”

> Remember: **“Three‑number rule – ₹300 crore capital, 10 years history, NPAs below 3%”** for the new UCB licence applicants.

## TOPIC 4: Tripura Gramin Bank – India’s First Fully Solar‑Powered ATM Van

### What happened?

- In January 2026, **Tripura Gramin Bank (TGB)** launched **India’s first fully solar‑powered ATM van**, branded **“TGB on Wheels”**.  
- Earlier, these mobile ATM vans ran on conventional power; after the upgrade they now operate on **100% solar energy**, using rooftop solar panels and battery storage.  
- The vans travel to remote and rural areas to provide **ATM withdrawals, balance enquiries and mini‑statements**, where regular branches or ATMs are not viable.  
- The project received support from **NABARD** and the bank’s innovation has been recognised with a **SKOCH Silver Award**.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Very likely MCQ: **Which bank launched India’s first fully solar‑powered ATM van? → Tripura Gramin Bank.**  
- This is an excellent case study combining **green banking, financial inclusion and the role of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)** – useful for mains descriptive answers.  
- It also illustrates partnership between **NABARD and RRBs** for last‑mile banking services.

### Memory Trick – “Tripura sun, ATM run”

> Visualise a **small ATM van with solar panels on top, labelled ‘TGB on Wheels’ running only on sunlight**.
