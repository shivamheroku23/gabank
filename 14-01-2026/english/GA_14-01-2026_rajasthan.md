- In mid‑January 2026, the Rajasthan government released a consolidated review of progress in about **25 flagship schemes**.  
- These schemes cover **rural and urban development, agriculture, water conservation, women’s empowerment, employment, skill training, housing and energy**.  
- The note highlighted that funds from both state and Centre are supporting programmes such as **PM Awas, Swachh Bharat (Urban), solar pumps, water‑harvesting structures, pensions and scholarships**.  
- Emphasis was placed on delivering benefits to the poor, women, youth and unorganised workers through **Jan‑Aadhaar and the Jan Soochna portal** in a transparent way.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- In mains, when writing on the **“Rajasthan model of welfare and development”**, these schemes can be cited as a group example.  
- It shows that differently named schemes share common objectives: **reducing poverty, strengthening social security and improving basic infrastructure**.

**Memory Trick – “25 lamps, 4 pillars”**

> Imagine **25 small lamps lighting up four pillars – farmers, women, youth and the poor – across Rajasthan**.

## TOPIC 2: Mukhyamantri Swanidhi Yojana – Support for Urban Unorganised Workers

### Kya hua?

- The review highlighted **Mukhyamantri Swanidhi Yojana**, which provides **small short‑term loans** to **urban unorganised workers** such as construction workers, gig workers, auto/tempo drivers, domestic workers and delivery workers.  
- The goal is to give these workers access to **low‑cost institutional credit** so they are not forced to borrow from moneylenders at very high interest.  
- Beneficiaries are also being linked via **Jan‑Aadhaar** to other benefits such as **health schemes, insurance and food security**.  
- Urban local bodies and the labour department are jointly collecting and verifying data on eligible workers.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- Direct one‑liner: **Mukhyamantri Swanidhi Yojana targets urban unorganised workers**, not big industries or farmers.  
- In RAS mains answers on urban livelihoods, street‑vendors or gig‑economy workers, this is a strong Rajasthan‑specific example.  
- For Police/Patwari exams it is a likely MCQ under **state schemes for urban poor**.

**Memory Trick – “Swanidhi = self‑reliant city worker”**

> Visualise an **urban worker or delivery boy getting a small loan from a government‑linked scheme instead of a moneylender** – that’s Swanidhi.

[Rajasthan Specific Current Affairs]  
## TOPIC 3: Lado Incentive Schemes – Support from Birth to Education

### Kya hua?

- The state has also emphasised **girl‑child incentive schemes**, generally grouped under **Lado‑type schemes**.  
- These schemes typically start with a small amount at birth and then provide further instalments at milestones such as **school admission, passing board exams and entering higher education**.  
- The aim is that families should not see a girl as an economic burden but as someone who receives **financial security plus strong education support** from the state.  
- Some versions also include components like **bicycles/scooters, scholarships and coaching assistance**.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- RAS/REET questions can ask the **broad objective of girl‑child incentive schemes in Rajasthan** – comprehensive support from birth through education.  
- In women‑empowerment and gender‑ratio answers, you can cite a **“Lado‑type incentive scheme”** as a state example.  
- It shows how Rajasthan is localising the national idea of **“Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao”** through its own financial‑incentive programmes.

**Memory Trick – “Lado = life‑roadmap of a girl”**

> Remember: **“From a girl’s birth to her degree, Lado keeps adding small deposits at each step.”**

## TOPIC 4: Atal Gyan Kendras &amp; Educated Rajasthan – Panchayat‑Level Knowledge Hubs

- These centres provide **computers, internet access, competitive‑exam material and digital learning facilities**.  
- Alongside, the **“Mukhyamantri Educated Rajasthan Campaign”** is attempting to bring school drop‑outs back into schools/colleges.  
- The Kendras are linked with **skill development, digital literacy and coaching support** so rural youth can be better prepared for the job market, acting as **local study hubs and career‑guidance points**.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- Likely one‑liner: **Atal Gyan Kendra is associated with digital/knowledge centres for rural youth**, not with mining or policing.  
- In mains answers on education and skills, **“Educated Rajasthan + Atal Gyan Kendras”** can be written as a combined reform package.  
- For Patwari/LDC‑type exams, this becomes a straightforward factual MCQ.

**Memory Trick – “Every panchayat’s mini digital library = Atal Gyan Kendra”**

> Picture a **small hall in a village with computers, internet and exam books** – that is the Atal Gyan Kendra.

## TOPIC 5: PM Awas (Urban), Swachh Bharat Urban, AMRUT – Strengthening Urban Basics

### Kya hua?

- The 25‑scheme review highlighted multiple programmes for **urban Rajasthan**:  
  - **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban)** – affordable housing for urban poor and low‑income households.  
  - **Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban)** – solid‑waste management, sewerage, public toilets and cleanliness projects.  
  - **AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation)** – improving urban drinking‑water supply, sewerage, and green spaces.  
- Cities like **Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur**, as well as smaller municipalities, are implementing projects that improve **housing, water and sanitation**.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- Rajasthan exams frequently ask what **sectors or objectives** each of these urban schemes correspond to.  
- In urban‑development answers, you can say the state and Centre are working together on **housing, water and sanitation** through these missions.  
- Matching‑type questions may test pairing of scheme name with its correct focus.

**Memory Trick – “Urban triangle: housing–cleanliness–water”**

> Imagine a triangle: **house (PM Awas), waste/toilet (Swachh Bharat Urban), water/sewer (AMRUT)** – the three pillars of urban Rajasthan.

[National Current Affairs]  
## TOPIC 6: World Bank Global Economic Prospects – India’s Growth Context

### Kya hua?

- The **World Bank’s “Global Economic Prospects (GEP) – January 2026”** report projects India’s growth for **FY 2025-26** at about **7.2%**.  
- For 2026, global growth is estimated at only around **2.6%**, so India stands out as the **fastest‑growing major economy**.  
- The report attributes India’s strength to domestic demand, reforms and investment.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- RAS/Police/Patwari exams can ask: **Which institution releases the Global Economic Prospects report? → World Bank.**  
- In economy answers you can use this as a data point to show that **India’s growth is much higher than the global average**.  
- While studying Rajasthan’s own GSDP, these national numbers help give comparative context.

**Memory Trick – “In GEP, Bharat is ahead of the world”**

> Visualise **two growth lines – the world at 2.6, India at above 7** – India clearly ahead.
