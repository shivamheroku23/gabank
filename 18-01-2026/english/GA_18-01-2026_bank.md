## TOPIC 1: RBI Recognises FEDAI as SRO for Forex Authorised Dealers

### What happened?

- The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has recognised the **Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI)** as a **Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO)** for all **Authorised Dealers (ADs)** in the foreign exchange market.  
- Recognition is under RBI’s **Omnibus Framework for SROs for Regulated Entities**, aimed at promoting **market discipline, transparency and self‑regulation**.  
- FEDAI has been given **one year** to align its governance structure with the SRO framework and expand membership to **all categories of ADs**.  
- FEDAI (founded in **1958**) is incorporated as a **Section 8 company** under the Companies Act, 2013; it frames **inter‑bank forex rules** and acts as a liaison between banks and RBI.  
- As per RBI norms, an SRO must have a **minimum net worth of ₹2 crore**, a **diversified shareholding** (no entity holding ≥10%), and at least **one‑third independent directors** including the Chairperson.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- FEDAI and its role in **forex market regulation** is a frequent topic in banking awareness.  
- MCQ angles:  
  - SRO for Authorised Dealers in forex? → **FEDAI**.  
  - Year FEDAI was established? → **1958**.  
  - Type of company? → **Section 8 (not-for-profit)**.  
- In mains/interviews, FEDAI’s SRO role is a good example of **“lighter‑touch regulation plus self‑discipline”** in India’s forex market.  

### Memory Trick – “FEDAI = Forex SRO”

> Just lock: **“FEDAI now = Forex SRO under RBI”** – think of a **“FEDAI Rule Book”** for all Authorised Dealers.

## TOPIC 2: RBI Allows Japan’s SMBC to Set Up a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary in India

### What happened?

- RBI has granted **in‑principle approval** to **Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Japan** to establish a **Wholly‑Owned Subsidiary (WOS)** in India.  
- A WOS is a **separate legal entity** incorporated in India, allowing a foreign bank to operate like a **domestic bank** – including opening new branches without prior RBI approval (subject to norms).  
- SMBC will convert its existing branches in **Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru** into this WOS, improving flexibility and growth prospects in the Indian market.  
- This follows SMBC’s **24.22% stake acquisition in YES Bank in 2025**, making SMBC the **largest shareholder** and deepening the YES Bank–SMBC partnership.  
- Foreign banks are required to choose a **“single‑mode presence”** – either branch model or WOS – and systemically important foreign banks in India are nudged towards the **WOS route** for better regulation and stability.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Foreign bank presence, **WOS vs branch model**, and RBI rules are frequent conceptual questions.  
- MCQ points:  
  - Country of origin of SMBC? → **Japan**.  
  - What does WOS stand for? → **Wholly‑Owned Subsidiary**.  
  - Minimum paid‑up voting equity capital required for a WOS? → **₹500 crore** (as per RBI norms).  
- Descriptive answers can use this case to explain **financial openness + regulatory safeguards** in India’s banking sector.  

### Memory Trick – “SMBC = Japanese bank, Indian WOS”

> Visualise **a Japanese flag next to an Indian bank building labelled “SMBC WOS – ₹500 crore capital”**.

## TOPIC 3: RBI Mandates Automated Complaint Management System with Internal Ombudsman (IO) Access

### What happened?

- RBI has directed **banks and eligible NBFCs** to implement a **fully automated Complaint Management System (CMS)** with direct access for the **Internal Ombudsman (IO)** and **Deputy IO (DIO)**.  
- Every bank with **10+ branches** must appoint at least **one IO**; deposit‑taking NBFCs and large NBFCs (₹5,000 crore+ assets, with public interface) are also covered with some category‑wise exemptions.  
- All complaints must be classified as **“fully resolved”**, **“partially resolved”** or **“wholly rejected”** before being **auto‑escalated to the IO** for independent review where required.  
- Time given to IO for review: at least **10 days** for complaints with pre‑set timelines (card networks, NPCI, etc.) and **20 days** for others. Final decision must reach the customer within **30 days** of the complaint.  
- IO/DIO appointments are **contractual**, minimum tenure **3 years**, maximum **5 years**; removal before term requires approval of the **Customer Service Committee (CSC) of the Board**. Only a **Whole‑Time/Executive Director** can overrule IO’s decision.  

(Official context: RBI directions on Internal Ombudsman & automated CMS; Photo: https://cdn.guidely.in/images/sliders/176035399766.webp)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- This topic links directly to **customer service, grievance redressal, and internal control** in banks – key bank GA themes.  
- Likely MCQs:  
  - Who appoints IO? → Each bank (with Board/CSC oversight).  
  - Maximum age for IO? (from guidelines) → **70 years**.  
  - IO’s background: **GM‑level officer with at least 7 years’ experience** in banking/financial sector.  
- It also connects with the external **RBI Integrated Ombudsman Scheme**, showing how complaints move **from bank level (IO) to RBI level**.  

### Memory Trick – “CMS + IO = internal filter before RBI Ombudsman”

> Picture a **complaint pipeline**: Customer → Bank CMS → IO/DIO → (if unresolved) RBI Ombudsman.

## TOPIC 4: Wholesale Inflation (WPI) Turns Positive at 0.83% in December 2025

### What happened?

- India’s **Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation** rose to **0.83% in December 2025**, the **first positive year‑on‑year print** after **two months of deflation** and the highest in about **eight months**.  
- In **November 2025**, WPI was **–0.32%**, so the December figure marks a clear turnaround.  
- The main driver was a narrowing of deflation in **food prices**; **primary food articles** saw deflation of **–0.43%** versus **–4.16%** in November, with vegetables, cereals and pulses improving.  
- **Manufactured products inflation** rose to about **1.82%**, and **core WPI** (excluding food & fuel) climbed to roughly **2%**, showing some pickup in industrial price pressures.  
- WPI uses **2011–12 as base year**, and manufactured products carry the highest weight (around **64.23%**). Experts expect WPI to average near **0.4% in FY26**, aided by low base effects and global commodity trends.  

(Official context: Office of Economic Adviser – WPI press note; Photo: https://cdn.guidely.in/images/sliders/176035399766.webp)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- WPI vs CPI, base year, components and recent trend are favourites in **economy & inflation** questions.  
- MCQ‑ready facts:  
  - WPI base year → **2011–12**.  
  - Largest component → **Manufactured goods (~64%)**.  
  - December 2025 WPI inflation → **0.83%**.  
- In mains, these numbers help in answers on **inflation dynamics, policy stance and growth‑inflation trade‑off**.  

### Memory Trick – “WPI flips from negative to +0.83%”

> Think: **“Minus 0.32% in Nov → Plus 0.83% in Dec”** – write it as **“–0.32 → +0.83”** on a rising arrow.
