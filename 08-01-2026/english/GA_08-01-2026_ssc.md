## TOPIC 1: RBI Report – Bank NPAs Low, Agriculture Sector Under Stress

### What happened?

- RBI’s latest report/Financial Stability analysis (coverage around **8 January 2026**) shows:  
  - the gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks is down to **~2.1–2.2%** (multi‑year low),  
  - the net NPA ratio is around **0.5%**.  
- The improvement is due to:  
  - balance‑sheet clean‑up,  
  - better recoveries and use of IBC.  
- But the composition of NPAs has changed:  
  - the **agriculture sector** now has the **largest share** of NPAs,  
  - in retail, rapid growth in **unsecured personal loans/credit cards** is a future risk area.  

### SSC exam points

- NPA = Non‑Performing Asset – loan overdue for more than 90 days.  
- Higher agriculture NPAs indicate rural distress and potential loan‑waiver pressure on banks.
