## TOPIC 1: RBI Report – Bank NPAs at Multi‑Year Lows, New Stress in Agriculture

### What happened?

- As per RBI’s latest **Financial Stability Report / sectoral analysis** (coverage around **8 January 2026**):  
  - **Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)** have seen their **Gross NPA ratio fall to ~2.1–2.2%** – a **multi‑year low**.  
  - **Net NPAs are around ~0.5%** – reflecting cumulative effects of AQR, IBC and recapitalisation.  
- The report notes that the decline in NPAs is driven mainly by:  
  - **recoveries and upgrades** (not just write‑offs),  
  - which means underlying borrower cash‑flows have genuinely improved.  
- However, the composition of NPAs has changed:  
  - the **agriculture sector now holds the largest share** of NPAs – higher than its share in total credit,  
  - in retail, rapid growth in **unsecured personal loans/credit cards** is showing emerging pockets of stress.  

*(Background: RBI FSR – Dec 2025; this summary is from 8 Jan 2026 banking coverage.)*

### Why important for bank exams?

- Facts to remember:  
  - SCB **GNPA ~2.1–2.2%, NNPA ~0.5%** (multi‑year lows).  
  - **Agriculture NPAs have the largest share** in the NPA pool.  
- Concept:  
  - The NPA cycle has shifted from large corporates to **agriculture + unsecured retail**,  
    which matters for PSL, KCC, and small‑borrower risk discussions.  
- Mains/interview use:  
  - “Explain how India’s NPA clean‑up has shifted systemic risk from large corporates to agriculture and unsecured retail credit.”  

### Memory Trick – “2–0.5, but farms still tough”

> Think: **“NPA 2–0.5 – banks look safe, but farm‑side risk is still alive.”**  
> GNPA ~2%, NNPA ~0.5%, yet agriculture carries the highest NPA share.

## TOPIC 2: IRDAI Investment Norms – New Framework after Insurance Act Amendments

### What happened?

- After 2025 amendments to the **Insurance Act, 1938**,  
  earlier **Sections 27A/27B/27C/27D** have been merged into a single unified **Section 27**.  
- Under the new structure:  
  - **Sovereign investments (Government securities, etc.)** remain defined in the Act,  
  - all other detailed investment norms will be set via **IRDAI regulations**, giving flexibility.  
- Key changes (as per business coverage, 2 Jan 2026):  
  - The **encumbrance ban** on assets backing policyholder liabilities **no longer applies to repo/reverse‑repo/securities‑lending** transactions –  
    this eases liquidity management for insurers.  
  - The old blanket ban on investments in **private limited companies** has been removed –  
    expanding the investment universe (with safeguards).  
- Insurance sector AUM is about **₹74.4 lakh crore** (March 2025),  
  a large part of which is in sovereign and long‑term debt.  

### Why important for bank exams?

- Insurers are major **long‑term institutional investors** in G‑Secs, corporate bonds, infrastructure and housing finance companies.  
- More flexibility for IRDAI means:  
  - deeper corporate‑bond and infrastructure markets,  
  - potentially better returns for policyholders,  
  - insurance products can compete more strongly with bank FDs and mutual funds.  
- Mains angle:  
  - “Discuss how the new Section 27 investment framework can help deepen India’s bond markets and support long‑term financing.”  

### Memory Trick – “27A–D all take the lift to 27”

> Imagine **Sections 27A–D all entering a lift and coming out as a single 27** –  
> IRDAI can now move up and down the ‘regulation floors’ to adjust norms more easily.

## TOPIC 3: Budget 2026 – Insurance Reforms &amp; Premium Financing as Credit Drivers

### What happened?

- Ahead of **Union Budget 2026**, the insurance industry expects:  
  - reforms to expand **insurance coverage and retirement security**,  
  - a smoother framework for **premium financing** (taking a loan to pay large policy premiums).  
- Budget preview commentary (7 Jan 2026) suggests:  
  - **simplified KYC, better data‑sharing and clearer digital‑lending norms**  
    can make premium‑financing products cheaper and faster,  
  - higher **tax deductions/incentives** on premiums may push customers towards higher‑ticket policies → more structured credit demand.  

### Why important for bank exams?

- For banks/NBFCs:  
  - **premium finance loans** are a potential retail product (secured by policy surrender value or other collateral),  
  - cross‑selling combo: insurance + loan + credit card/wealth → both fee and interest income.  
- Mains/interview topic:  
  - “In what ways can insurance‑led reforms in Budget 2026 create a credit boom? Explain premium financing with reference to digital‑lending rules.”  

### Memory Trick – “Big policy + smooth EMI = credit combo”

> Think: **“Budget 2026: bigger policies, smoother EMIs”** –  
> the combination can drive a retail credit boom.

## TOPIC 4: India Fintech 2025 – $2.5 Billion Funding Despite Fewer Deals

### What happened?

- In 2025, India’s overall startup funding fell to about **$11 billion** (YoY ~8% decline),  
  but the **fintech sector remained relatively strong**:  
  - about **$2.5 billion** raised across **~120 deals** (7 Jan 2026 reports).  
- Trends:  
  - **fewer deals**, but with **larger ticket sizes** – median deal ~**$20.8 million**,  
  - key focus areas:  
    - **credit‑led consumption** (personal loans, gold loans, BNPL, credit cards),  
    - **payments infrastructure** (gateways, UPI rails, switches),  
    - **wealthtech/insurtech**.  

### Why important for bank exams?

- This pattern shows that:  
  - banks will increasingly rely on **fintech partners for data, underwriting and compliance**,  
  - strong card/personal‑loan growth → a rise in **unsecured retail risk**,  
    exactly the area RBI’s FSR is flagging.  
- Mains:  
  - “Discuss recent fintech funding trends and their implications for banks’ retail‑credit and risk strategies.”  

### Memory Trick – “Fewer deals, fatter cheques”

> Line: **“Fintech did fewer deals, but each cheque was fatter – $2.5B in just ~120 deals.”**

## TOPIC 5: PLI Scheme – Steel &amp; Mobile Manufacturing Boost, Credit Scope for Banks

### What happened?

- The government’s **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme** (since April 2020)  
  has shown visible impact (as per 8 Jan 2026 economy coverage):  
  - **crude steel output** rose from ~**103.5 MT (2020‑21)** to **144.3 MT (2023‑24)**,  
  - finished steel domestic consumption crossed **136 MT**,  
  - **electronics output** rose from ~₹5.5 lakh crore (2020‑21) to around **₹9.5 lakh crore (2023‑24)**,  
  - within this, **mobile‑phone manufacturing ~₹4.22 lakh crore** (about **44.3%** of total electronics output),  
  - medical‑devices exports also increased from ~$2.5 bn to ~$3.8 bn (2020‑21 → 2023‑24).  

### Why important for bank exams?

- High‑capex sectors (steel, mobiles, medical devices) require:  
  - **term loans, project finance, working capital, export/trade finance**,  
  - so PLI‑driven capacity expansion directly boosts bank‑credit demand.  
- Mains point:  
  - “Explain how PLI schemes support India’s manufacturing and create term‑loan and working‑capital opportunities for banks.”  

### Memory Trick – “PLI = Produce, Loan, Invest”

> Remember PLI as: **P – Produce (factory), L – Loan (bank), I – Invest (capex &amp; exports)** –  
> the scheme pushes production and opens loan/investment opportunities.
