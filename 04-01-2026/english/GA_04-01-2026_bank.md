## TOPIC 1: Agriculture Minister’s Advisory on PM‑KISAN / PMFBY Funds

### What happened?

- Union Agriculture &amp; Farmers’ Welfare Minister **Shivraj Singh Chouhan**  
  held a meeting with State/UT agriculture ministers and officials and advised them to:  
  - **expedite utilisation** of funds under  
    - **PM‑KISAN**,  
    - **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)**, and  
    - other agriculture schemes  
  - by **March 2026**.  
- Focus areas:  
  - timely DBT instalments to farmers,  
  - quicker settlement of pending insurance claims,  
  - better utilisation record to support future budget allocations.

### Why important for bank exams?

- PM‑KISAN benefits are transferred **100% through DBT directly into farmers’ bank accounts**,  
  making bank accounts, KYC and Aadhaar‑seeding critical.  
- Under PMFBY, **premium debits, claim pay‑outs and subsidy flows** all move through banks;  
  timely fund utilisation can help **reduce NPAs and improve repayment capacity** of farmers.

### Memory Trick – “KISAN = KYC + Insurance + Subsidy in Account Now”

> **KISAN** = **KYC**, **Insurance**, **Subsidy**, **Account**, **Now** –  
> money must reach the farmer’s account on time.

## TOPIC 2: Sin Goods Tax – Health &amp; National Security Cess (Follow‑up)

- Around 3 January, notified changes clarified that on products like  
  **tobacco, pan masala, gutkha**, etc.,  
  the earlier **GST Compensation Cess** will be replaced by  
  **Additional Excise Duty + Health &amp; National Security Cess**.  
- Base GST rates remain broadly the same; the new Cess is an additional levy on top.

### Bank/economy angle

- The **sin tax** concept is popular in exams:  
  - higher indirect tax on harmful goods →  
    aims to raise revenue and discourage consumption.  
- It links **fiscal consolidation** with **health spending** requirements.

### Memory Trick – “If you smoke, extra HN stroke”

> Line: **“Jo health ko smoke kare, us par HN Cess ka stroke पड़े.”**  
> (If you harm health, extra Health &amp; National Security Cess will hit you.)

## TOPIC 3: Musi Riverfront Development Project – ADB Loan

### What happened?

- The **Asian Development Bank (ADB)** has approved a loan of about  
  **US$ 500 million (~₹4,100 crore)** for  
  the **Musi Riverfront Development Project (Phase‑I)** in Telangana (Hyderabad).  
- Project aims:  
  - slum redevelopment along the Musi river,  
  - flood management and sewage treatment,  
  - riverfront promenades and public spaces,  
  - better integration with public transport.

### Bank/finance angle

- An ADB **sovereign loan** means:  
  - long‑term funding for the State and Urban Local Bodies,  
  - opportunities for Indian banks in **co‑financing, project finance and municipal bonds**.  
- Urban infrastructure finance is an emerging topic in banking exams.

### Memory Trick – “Musi makeover via ADB takeover”

> Remember: **“Musi ko makeover – ADB ka takeover.”**

## TOPIC 4: DGFT &amp; FCI – New Appointments

### DGFT Chief – Lav Aggarwal

  **Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)**.

- FCI:  
  - procures foodgrains at MSP,  
  - manages storage and transport,  
  - ensures supply to PDS and maintains buffer stocks.

### Why important for bank exams?

- DGFT and FCI are key institutions for **trade and food security**:  
  - name–post type MCQs,  
  - examples in mains answers on MSP, export support, subsidy burden, etc.

### Memory Trick – “Lav – foreign trade, Rabindra – ration”

> **Lav Aggarwal → foreign trade (DGFT)**,  
> **Rabindra Kumar Agarwal → ration/food (FCI)**.

## TOPIC 5: Forex Reserves – Week Ended 26 Dec 2025

### Bank/economy angle
