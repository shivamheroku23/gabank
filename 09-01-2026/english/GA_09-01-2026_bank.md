## TOPIC 1: RBI–Delhi Government MoU for Banking &amp; Public Debt Management

### What happened?

- The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** and the **Government of NCT of Delhi** signed a **Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** on **6 January 2026**.  
- Under the agreement, effective **9 January 2026**, RBI becomes Delhi’s:  
  - **Official banker, debt manager and financial agent**,  
  - Handles all **general banking operations** (receipts, payments, treasury),  
  - Manages **rupee public debt / State Development Loans (SDLs)** for Delhi.  
- Earlier, Delhi largely depended on **high‑cost borrowing at around 12–13%** from other sources;  
  now it can raise funds via **market‑based SDLs at roughly 7%**.  
- RBI will also:  
  - **Automatically invest Delhi’s surplus cash balances** on a daily basis, and  
  - Provide **Ways and Means Advances (WMA) and Special Drawing Facility (SDF)** to manage temporary cash‑flow mismatches.  

*(Background: MoU executed under the RBI Act, 1934 framework on government banking arrangements.)*

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Illustrates RBI’s role as **banker and debt manager to governments**; Delhi (a UT with legislature) is now part of this framework.  
- **SDL issuance via RBI auctions** creates additional high‑quality securities for banks, insurers and PFs to invest in.  
- Lower borrowing cost + better cash management → improved **sub‑national fiscal health and market discipline**.  
- Mains / interview: linkage between **RBI, states/UTs and India’s fiscal federalism**.

### Memory Trick – “Delhi’s Account at RBI”

> Think: **“From 9 January, Delhi’s treasury runs through RBI.”**  
> Delhi’s banking and debt now sit within the RBI system.

## TOPIC 2: RBI Draft Norms – Dividend Payout Cap up to 75% of PAT

### What happened?

- On **7 January 2026**, RBI released the draft **“Commercial Banks – Prudential Norms on Declaration of Dividend and Remittance of Profits, 2026.”**  
- Key proposal:  
  - Raise banks’ **maximum dividend payout ratio** from the earlier 40%  
    to **up to 75% of Profit After Tax (PAT)**, subject to capital strength.  
  - For **Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Local Area Banks (LABs)**, the cap is **up to 80% of PAT**.  
- Framework details:  
  - A **ten‑bucket structure** based on **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio** – higher CET1 → higher permissible payout.  
  - Banks with **CET1 below 8% will not be allowed to declare any dividend**.  
  - Boards must examine **asset quality, provisioning gaps, capital projections and growth plans** before recommending dividends.  
- RBI has clarified that dividends **cannot** be paid out of:  
  - Exceptional or extraordinary income,  
  - Unrealised gains from fair valuation,  
  - Mere reversal of excess provisions (unless expressly permitted).

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- **Objective-type points:**  
  - Caps: **75% of PAT** for commercial banks; **80% of PAT** for RRBs/LABs.  
  - Cut‑off: **CET1 &lt; 8% ⇒ no dividend**.  
- Conceptually: ensures **shareholder payouts are aligned with capital strength and risk**,  
  preventing under‑capitalised banks from hollowing out their net worth.  
- Mains: How **prudential dividend norms** support financial stability.

### Memory Trick – “75–80 with CET1 Gate”

> Remember: **“75 for banks, 80 for rural banks; CET1 below 8 – dividend blank.”**

## TOPIC 3: Supervisory Data Quality Index – Banks Score 90.7

### What happened?

- RBI has created the **Supervisory Data Quality Index (sDQI)** to measure the quality of data submitted by banks in regulatory returns.  
- The index tracks four parameters: **accuracy, timeliness, completeness and consistency**.  
- For **September 2025 quarter**, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) recorded:  
  - **Aggregate sDQI score of 90.7**, up from **89.9** in June 2025.  
  - **Timeliness** improved to around **93.5**, showing faster and more disciplined filing of returns.  
- Category‑wise performance (approximate):  
  - **Small Finance Banks – ~91.5 (top performers)**,  
  - **Public Sector Banks – ~91.1**,  
  - **Private Banks – ~90.6**,  
  - **Foreign Banks – ~90.4**.  

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- High‑quality supervisory data allows RBI to:  
  - Run more reliable **stress tests and early‑warning systems**,  
  - Take timely corrective action, strengthening **financial stability**.  
- For banks, it underlines the importance of **data governance, internal controls and IT systems**.  
- Good main/PI point: “Data is the new capital for regulation.”

### Memory Trick – “DQ above 90”

> Think: **“Data Quality (DQ) for banks has crossed 90 – sDQI ≈ 90.7 in Sept 2025.”**

---

## TOPIC 4: HDFC Bank – Digital Rupee (e₹) on SmartGateway

### What happened?

- On **6 January 2026**, **HDFC Bank** announced integration of RBI’s **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Rupee (e₹)**  
  with its **SmartGateway online merchant payment platform**.  
- This allows **SmartGateway merchants** to:  
  - Accept **Digital Rupee payments** from customers,  
  - At **zero transaction cost** (no merchant discount rate), as per the bank’s statement.  
- For customers, Digital Rupee offers:  
  - Sovereign‑backed digital money,  
  - Instant settlement and high security,  
  - A UPI‑like experience but with **central bank money**.  

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Converts CBDC from a pilot concept into a **live retail payments use‑case**.  
- For banks and merchants:  
  - Potentially **lower settlement risk and operating cost**,  
  - New rails for **online commerce and treasury**.  
- Mains/interview: **Compare CBDC vs UPI** – settlement, intermediaries, and regulatory angle.

### Memory Trick – “SmartGateway = Smart e₹ Gateway”

> Remember the phrase: **“HDFC SmartGateway has become a smart gateway for e₹.”**

## TOPIC 5: Indian Banking Sector – Fitch &amp; S&amp;P’s Positive View

### What happened?

- A recent **Fitch** assessment (Jan 2026 coverage) notes that Indian banks are on a **stronger footing**:  
  - **Gross NPA ratio ~2.2% in H1 FY26**, down sharply from **11.2% in FY18**.  
  - **CET1 ratio ~14.8% in FY26**, vs **9.3% in FY14**.  
  - **Return on Assets (RoA) ~1.3%**, comparable with many Asia‑Pacific peers.  
  - **Banking credit‑to‑GDP ~59% (2025)** vs peer average ~101%,  
    indicating **room for credit to grow faster than nominal GDP**, if underwriting stays prudent.  
- **S&amp;P Global** (via an IBEF report) highlighted that Indian banks’ **market capitalisation increased in Q3 2023**  
  on the back of strong festive demand, better sentiment and robust credit offtake.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Provides **data‑backed narrative** on why Indian banking is considered structurally stronger today:  
  - Lower NPAs, stronger capital, better profitability.  
- Helps in mains/interview answers on topics like **financial stability, growth and credit cycle**.  

### Memory Trick – “From 11 to 2, from 9 to 15, with 59% room”

> One line: **“NPA 11→2, capital 9→15, credit‑GDP 59 – India’s banks have room to grow.”**
