*(Facts RBI circular text + FIDC summary note jaisi compilations par based hain; detailed wording ke liye official circular refer karein – FIDC PDF: “RBI Pre‑payment Charges – 02.07.25”.)*

### Bank exam ke liye kyun important?

- Direct **retail banking** & **MSME lending** topic:  
  - MCQ me puch sakte: *“RBI (Pre‑payment Charges on Loans) Directions, 2025 kis type ke loans se linked hain?”*  
- Concept angle:  
  - Jab pre‑payment charges kam / ban hote hain → log **rate cut ka benefit lene ke liye loan refinance** kar sakte hain.  
  - Competition badhta hai, banks ko **pricing + service** par focus karna padta hai.  
- Mains:  
  - “Discuss RBI’s approach to borrower protection through regulation of pre‑payment charges.”  

### Memory Trick – “Free Exit Gate on Floating Loans”

> Yaad rakho: **Floating‑rate retail/MSME loans ke liye RBI ne ‘pre‑payment penalty ka gate’ khol diya – borrower ko free exit path.**

Code:  
- **P = Pre‑payment**, **P = Protection (for borrower)** → **PP Directions 2025**.

### Kya hua?

- RBI ne **19 June 2025** ko **“RBI (Project Finance) Directions, 2025”** issue kiye (RBI/2025‑26/59 – legal/consulting summaries ke aadhar par), effective **1 October 2025**.

  - Banks ko **standardised framework** mile taaki *infrastructure push* ke saath **asset quality** safe rahe.  
- Exam points:  
  - “RBI (Project Finance) Directions, 2025 – effective from?” → **1 October 2025**.  
  - **CRE / CRE‑RH** classification & risk weight topics – often case study / mains me aate hain.  

### Memory Trick – “1 October se Project ka New Rulebook”

> Line: **“June 19 ko book publish hui, 1 October se Project Finance ki nayi rulebook fully lagu hui.”**

Code mapping:  
- **19/6/25 – issue**, **1/10/25 – effect** → 19–6–1–10 sequence yaad rakho.

### Memory Trick – “IRD = Interest Rate Dangal – 1 March se Naya Rule”

- Mains:  
  - “Discuss RBI’s recent steps to manage risks from bank‑NBFC conglomerates.” – yahan ye amendment core example hai.  

### Memory Trick – “Family Distance Rule”

> Yaad rakho: **“Bank aur uske group NBFC / family members ke beech zyada close credit rishta allowed nahi – RBI ne distance rule laga diya.”**

Code: **G = Group, G = Guardrails** → RBI ne **group ke liye guardrails** lagaye.

Isse yaad rakho: **30 Dec 2025 – SEBI + Certification + Compliance Officer (AIF).**
