## TOPIC 1: RBI’s 2026 Digital Banking Directions

### What happened?

- The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has issued comprehensive **Digital Banking Directions** that became effective on **1 January 2026** for banks and eligible urban co‑operative banks.  
- These directions consolidate earlier internet and mobile banking guidelines into a single framework, covering **online account opening, balance enquiries, fund transfers, card management, UPI and other app-based services**.  
- Banks must now obtain **explicit, granular customer consent** for each digital service, disclose charges in a standard format and put in place clear mechanisms for **revoking permissions**.  
- The rules mandate **stronger cyber-security controls** – multi-factor authentication, device-binding, real-time fraud monitoring and faster incident reporting to RBI.  
- Boards are made **directly responsible** for approving digital strategies, outsourcing arrangements with fintech partners and for periodic cyber audits.  

(Official context: RBI – upcoming master directions on digital banking and technology risk; see https://www.rbi.org.in &gt; Notifications)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Questions can test the **scope of digital banking directions** – which entities are covered, what services fall under “digital banking”, and what kind of customer consent is required.  
- It links with themes like **consumer protection, cyber-security, operational risk and outsourcing to fintechs** – common in mains and interview discussions.  
- Aspirants should connect it to topics like **e-rupee pilots, UPI ecosystem, payment aggregators and digital lending guidelines**, which together define India’s new digital-finance architecture.

### Memory Trick – “2026 = Digital Directions for Banking”

> Think: **“26 = DD” → 2026 brings Digital Directions: consent, cyber, and board ‘duty’ for all mobile/net banking.**

## TOPIC 2: RBI’s Crackdown on Dormant and Zero-Balance Accounts

### What happened?

- From **10 January 2026**, new RBI-backed rules start pushing banks to actively deal with **inactive, dormant and abandoned accounts**, especially those lying unused for years.  
- Under the clarified framework, an account is tagged **inactive after 12 months** without customer‑initiated transactions, and **dormant after 24 months** of such inactivity.  
- Banks will now be required to **reach out to customers**, and if no response or activity is seen over an extended period, they can **close long‑neglected accounts** after due notice.  
- Balances in such accounts are transferred to the **Depositor Education and Awareness (DEA) Fund** maintained by RBI, from where customers or legal heirs can still claim money later with proper documents.  
- Zero‑balance or almost‑unused accounts opened for one‑off purposes (salary, schemes, camps) without any ongoing transactions will receive special scrutiny.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Direct MCQs can ask: **after how many years does an account become dormant**, and where the funds go after closure (**DEA Fund**).  
- Conceptually, it shows RBI’s focus on **cleaner balance sheets, lower fraud risk and better customer outreach**, which ties into questions on **financial stability and consumer protection**.  
- In interviews, this can be used as an example of how **“Jan Dhan se Jan Upyog”** thinking is shifting from mere account opening to **active, safe usage**.

### Memory Trick – “2 years silent → dormancy, money goes to DEA”

> Line: **“12 months inactive, 24 months dormant – phir paisa DEA Fund ke ‘dear’ account mein.”**

## TOPIC 3: India Tightens Crypto KYC and AML Norms

### What happened?

- The **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU‑India)** under the Finance Ministry has issued a stricter **KYC/AML framework for users of crypto exchanges** operating in India.  
- New onboarding requires **live selfie verification with liveness detection**, so that only real users – not deepfakes or stolen photos – can open and operate accounts.  
- Exchanges must also capture **geo‑tagging information (location + IP)** at signup and verify customer **bank accounts via a small “penny-drop” transaction**, linking trading accounts to real financial identities.  
- Additional measures include mandatory **PAN + secondary ID**, regular KYC updates, and a **ban on mixers, tumblers and certain privacy tokens** that hide transaction trails.  
- The guidelines aim to align India with **FATF standards** and reduce the risk of **money laundering, terror financing and proliferation financing** through virtual digital assets.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Crypto is now explicitly brought inside the **PMLA/FIU reporting framework** – a favourite theme for GA on compliance and financial stability.  
- Banks that provide **settlement accounts, payment gateways or card access** to exchanges must understand these KYC norms and incorporate them in their risk assessment.  
- MCQs may test **which body issued the norms (FIU‑India)**, and which checks (live selfie, geo‑tagging, bank validation) are part of the new crypto KYC.

### Memory Trick – “Selfie + location + bank for every crypto user”

> Short code: **“Crypto KYC 3‑step – selfie live, geo‑tag, penny‑drop bank check.”**

## TOPIC 4: Stronger Frameworks for Payment Aggregators and Digital Lending

### What happened?

- In **September 2025**, RBI issued **revised master directions for Payment Aggregators (PAs)**, with phased compliance running across **2026** for governance, capital and technology norms.  
- The directions expand coverage to include more **offline (POS/QR) and cross‑border payment aggregation**, tighten rules on **escrow accounts and settlement timelines**, and insist on stricter **merchant due‑diligence and data localisation**.  
- Parallelly, RBI’s **Digital Lending Directions (2025)** are being implemented through 2026, forcing banks and NBFCs to clearly **disclose charges, avoid predatory recovery practices, and assume responsibility for loans sourced via apps and platforms**.  
- Lenders must ensure that loan apps show **RBI‑regulated entities upfront**, credit flows directly between **borrower and RE bank accounts**, and customer data is not misused by third‑party tech partners.

(Official context: RBI master directions on Payment Aggregators and Digital Lending – https://www.rbi.org.in &gt; Notifications; Photo (representational): https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/default.jpg)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- PAs and digital lenders sit at the heart of India’s **UPI, card and instant‑loan ecosystem** – frequent exam territory.  
- MCQs can ask about **who regulates PAs**, what is meant by **escrow accounts** or **direct loan disbursal and repayment between bank accounts**.  
- For mains/interviews, this provides a concrete example of RBI **closing regulatory arbitrage** between banks and fintechs while still allowing innovation.

### Memory Trick – “PA + DL = clean pipes for payments and loans”

> Remember: **“2026 – Payment Aggregators and Digital Lending rules clean up the ‘pipes’ carrying money in and out of banks.”**

## TOPIC 5: January 2026 Financial Resets – PAN–Aadhaar, Credit Scores and 8th Pay Commission

### What happened?

- From **1 January 2026**, multiple regulatory changes took effect together, reshaping India’s retail finance landscape.  
- **PAN–Aadhaar linking** has been made effectively mandatory – non‑linked PANs risk being treated as **inoperative**, affecting tax filing, refunds and high‑value banking transactions.  
- **Credit bureaus** will now **update loan repayment and default data weekly** (instead of roughly fortnightly), making credit scores much more **real‑time and sensitive** to borrower behaviour.  
- New **co‑lending rules** require each lender in a co‑lending arrangement to retain at least **10% of the loan on its own books**, ensuring fair risk‑sharing between banks and NBFC/fintech partners.  
- Simultaneously, implementation of the **8th Pay Commission from 1 January 2026** is expected to boost **salaries and pensions** of central government staff, supporting consumption and deposit growth over the next few years.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- PAN–Aadhaar and co‑lending rules influence **KYC, tax compliance and credit‑risk sharing**, all core banking topics.  
- More frequent credit‑bureau updates impact **risk models, provisioning and pricing** – relevant for objective and descriptive questions.  
- The 8th Pay Commission’s income boost can be linked to **loan demand, CASA growth and asset quality**, useful in macro and interview answers.

### Memory Trick – “1‑1‑26: PAN link, pay hike, faster scores”

> Code: **“On 1‑1‑26 → PAN linked, pay commission kicks in, credit scores update faster and co‑lending shares 10% skin in the game.”**
