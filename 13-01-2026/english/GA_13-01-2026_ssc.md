## TOPIC 3: OrbitAid’s AyulSAT – In-Orbit Refuelling Demo

### What happened?

- Chennai-based startup **OrbitAid Aerospace** is set to demonstrate **in‑orbit satellite refuelling** for the first time in India through its mission **AyulSAT**.  
- **AyulSAT** is a 25‑kg “tanker satellite and target spacecraft” launched onboard **ISRO’s PSLV‑C62** mission, designed to test fuel, power and data transfer in space.  
- The mission will use a standardised **SIDRP docking and refuelling interface** to move propellant internally and, in later phases, between two separate spacecraft.  
- Success would allow future satellites to be **refuelled and serviced in orbit**, extending their life and reducing space debris.

## TOPIC 4: Orobanche Weed Threatens Mustard in Rajasthan & Haryana

### What happened?

- The parasitic weed **Orobanche aegyptiaca** (locally called **Margoja**) is spreading rapidly in **mustard fields of Rajasthan and Haryana**, causing serious yield losses.  
- It is a **root-parasitic flowering plant** that attaches to the host’s roots and steals water, carbon and nutrients, often going unnoticed until crops suddenly wilt or stunt.  
- Its tiny seeds can survive in soil for **up to 20 years**, making eradication very difficult once fields are infested.  
- The weed is triggered especially after the **first irrigation**, and one plant can release **thousands of seeds**, causing fast spread across farms through soil, tools and irrigation water.  

(Official / detailed context: reports on Orobanche infestation in mustard; Photo: https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Orobanche-aegyptiaca.jpg)

### SSC exam points:

- Crop affected → mainly **mustard** (oilseed) in **Rajasthan and Haryana**.  
- Nature → **root-parasitic weed**, not a fungus or insect.  
- Impact → reduces yields, threatens India’s **edible oil self‑reliance** efforts.  
- Seeds remain viable in soil for **many years (long-term infestation)**.
