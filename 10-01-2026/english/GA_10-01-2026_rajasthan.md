### TOPIC 1: 8,000+ new constables join Rajasthan Police (Jaipur)

### What Happened?

- On 10 January 2026, Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah addressed the appointment letter distribution ceremony for newly appointed Rajasthan Police constables in Jaipur.
- More than 8,000 youths joined Rajasthan Police as constables in this batch, with over 2,500 women constables – roughly one-third of the intake.
- The event also saw the virtual inauguration of a Multipurpose Indoor Hall and the felicitation of Ratannagar Police Station (Churu district) as the best police station in Rajasthan.
- Amit Shah emphasised that the recruitment was conducted without any bribe or recommendation, based purely on merit and technology-driven transparent procedures.
- He noted that the Bhajan Lal Sharma government has ended the paper leak culture in police recruitment which existed under the previous regime.
- The Home Minister highlighted that Rajasthan Police, established in March 1949, operates in challenging geography – international border with Pakistan, Chambal ravines, the Thar desert and major tourist circuits.
- He appealed to recruits to take their training seriously so that they can contribute to a “secure Rajasthan” under the new criminal law framework.
- (Official: PIB – https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2213303)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Rajasthan Police recruitment is a favourite area in RAS, SI/Constable and CET – questions may ask year of formation (1949), numbers recruited, share of women, or key reforms (end of paper leaks).
- Crime statistics mentioned (overall crimes down ~14%, serious crimes ~19%, murders down 25%, crimes against women down 10% etc.) can be used in mains answers on law and order.
- Names to remember: Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Ratannagar Police Station (best police station in Rajasthan).
- The focus on transparent, merit-based recruitment and technology (Abhay Command Centre, CCTNS integration, cyber helpline) links to topics like good governance and e-governance.
- First batch to join after implementation of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita – can be linked with new criminal law questions.

### Memory Trick – “8000 shields, 2500 shakti”

> Think: “Jaipur parade se nikle 8,000 shields, jismein 2,500 ‘shakti’ (women constables) – naya security cover for Rajasthan.”

### TOPIC 2: ED to probe ₹2,000 crore Rajasthan mid-day meal scheme irregularities

### What Happened?

- On 10 January 2026, reports stated that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will register a money laundering case in alleged irregularities in the mid-day meal dry ration scheme in Rajasthan.
- The case is based on a 22-page FIR lodged by the Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on 7 January 2026.
- The FIR names 21 accused, including retired officials of the Rajasthan Cooperative Consumer Federation Ltd (CONFED), private persons and firms.
- The alleged irregularities relate to supplying dry ration packets (pulses, cooking oil and spices) to students of Classes 1–8 between 2020 and 2023.
- According to the ACB FIR, over 3 crore students were to receive packets in five phases, with the state spending about ₹2,023.91 crore on the scheme.
- The FIR alleges inflated pricing, delayed supplies, non-existent quality control and payments without delivery, causing an estimated loss of around ₹2,000 crore to the state exchequer.
- Earlier, ED had registered an ECIR in 2023 but the primary state case was closed; ED then sent its evidence to ACB in 2024 under Section 66(2) of the PMLA, leading to the present FIR.
- (Reputed sources: Business Standard, PTI copy – https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/ed-to-file-money-laundering-case-in-2-000-cr-rajasthan-mid-day-meal-scam-126011000549_1.html)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Mid-day meal schemes and school nutrition are frequently asked in RAS, teacher exams (REET) and Patwari/Junior Accountant papers.
- The case combines topics of cooperative federations (CONFED), corruption control (ACB, ED) and implementation gaps in welfare schemes.
- Amounts and periods are exam-relevant: about ₹2,000 crore alleged scam; five phases between 2020–23; over 3 crore students; 21 accused.
- Useful for mains answers on “leakages in welfare schemes”, “public procurement issues” and the role of PMLA in state-level corruption cases.
- Knowing that ED information sharing under Section 66(2) of PMLA can trigger state ACB FIRs adds depth to polity/governance answers.

### Memory Trick – “3 crore bacche, 2 hazaar crore ka sawal”

> Link the numbers: “3 crore baccho ka bhojan, par 2,000 crore par sawal – CONFED aur dry ration pe ED–ACB ki joint nazar.”

### TOPIC 3: Jaipur Audi crash – road safety under spotlight

### What Happened?

- On the night before 10 January 2026, a speeding Audi car crashed near Kharabas Circle in the Patrakar Colony area of Jaipur.
- CCTV visuals show the car first hitting a divider and then ploughing through roadside food stalls, carts and pedestrians over a stretch of around 30 metres.
- Around 16 people came under the car’s impact; one person died and about 14–15 were injured, with several shifted to SMS and Jaipuria hospitals.
- Reports indicate that four people were inside the car; some occupants allegedly tried to flee but at least one was caught by locals and handed over to police.
- The driver has been identified in reports as businessman Dinesh Rinwa (also written as Rinwa/Ranwan in some sources), allegedly under the influence of alcohol, and the car was reportedly racing with another vehicle.
- Police have seized the Audi, collected mobile phones from the vehicle and taken CCTV footage for investigation; overspeeding and drunk driving are prime angles.
- The incident triggered political reactions, with the Chief Minister directing strict action and proper medical treatment for the injured.
- (Reputed sources: NDTV, India Today, Times of India – e.g. https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1-dead-15-injured-as-drunk-speeding-audi-driver-runs-over-them-in-jaipur-rajasthan-10585018)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Location-based questions: Patrakar Colony, Kharabas Circle, SMS Hospital, Jaipuria Hospital – common in police and constable papers.
- Highlights Motor Vehicles Act provisions (overspeeding, drunk driving, hit-and-run), useful in law sections for police and RAS mains.
- Can be used as a case study in essays on “urbanisation and road safety”, “responsible driving” and “role of CCTV in investigation”.
- Likely to lead to stricter local enforcement drives – exam questions may ask about new traffic initiatives in Jaipur following the incident.

### Memory Trick – “Patrakar Colony ka painful video”

> Remember: “Patrakar Colony, Audi ka video – ek hi raat ne road safety ko exam-point topic bana diya.”

### TOPIC 4: Cold wave – school holidays extended in Rajasthan

### What Happened?

- Rajasthan is facing a severe cold wave and dense to very dense fog in many districts in early January 2026.
- As per district orders highlighted in national education news, Jaipur district extended holidays for students up to Class 5 till 10 January 2026.
- In Jaipur, Classes 6–8 were given holidays up to 8 January 2026, but staff (teaching and non-teaching) are required to attend school and exams are being held as scheduled.
- Jalore district extended holidays from pre-primary to Class 5 till 10 January due to cold conditions.
- Reports mention that 20–25 districts, including Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur and others, have similar orders for junior classes, with some considering extensions till Makar Sankranti depending on weather.
- Official statewide winter vacation was originally from 25 December 2025 to 5 January 2026; extensions have been granted at district level using collector powers.
- Parents have been advised to follow local administration and school notices for exact dates and timings.
- (Reputed sources: India Today, Times of India, News18 – e.g. https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/schools-closed-due-to-cold-wave-state-wise-list-after-january-9-2849466-2026-01-09)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Directly relevant for REET, school lecturer, Grade-III teacher and other education-related exams – current rules about winter vacations are often asked.
- Shows how district collectors use Section 144/administrative powers for safety during extreme weather (governance + disaster management).
- Locations and classes affected can appear in factual questions (e.g. “Jaipur and Jalore extended holidays up to which class and till which date?”).
- Good example for RAS mains answers on “impact of climate change/extreme weather on schooling and learning outcomes in Rajasthan.”

### Memory Trick – “Class 5 tak thand ki chhutti, staff ke liye duty”

> “Yaad rakho: Jaipur–Jalore mein Class 5 tak chhutti 10 January tak, par teachers ki duty full – cold wave but no break for staff.”

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Sports achievements linked with Rajasthan are a regular feature in RAS prelims and Police/Constable GK sections.

- Media coverage for 2026 emphasises Hindi’s presence in global education, digital platforms, cinema and among the Indian diaspora.
- World Hindi Day is distinct from “Hindi Diwas”, which is celebrated on 14 September to mark adoption of Hindi (Devanagari script) as an official language of India in 1949.
- (Reputed sources: NDTV, India Today – e.g. https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/world-hindi-day-2026-history-significance-and-global-presence-of-the-language-10590903)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Days and themes are common questions in all Rajasthan exams, especially REET, RSMSSB and Police constable papers.
- For descriptive answers on “Hindi and Rajasthani languages”, this day provides good factual backing.
- Difference between World Hindi Day (10 January) and Hindi Diwas (14 September) itself is a probable MCQ.
