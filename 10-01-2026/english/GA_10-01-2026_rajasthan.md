### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- The name “Rajasthan AI‑ML Policy 2026”, its year and objectives are direct MCQ material for RAS prelims and relevant for mains answers.
- Key terms: ethical AI, transparency, accountability, AI nodal officer, AI Centre of Excellence, iStart LMS, AVGC‑XR – all can appear in one-liners or matching type questions.
- For descriptive questions on “Digital Rajasthan”, “AI in governance” or “innovation-led growth”, this is a fresh, Rajasthan-specific case study.
- It also illustrates centre–state coordination under the IndiaAI Mission, useful in polity/governance answers.

**Memory Trick – “Three A of Jaipur: AI‑ML–AVGC”**

## TOPIC 2: Green Credit Voucher Initiative‑2025 – Rajasthan’s green incentive model

### What happened?

- The Rajasthan Cabinet approved the **Green Credit Voucher Initiative‑2025**, implementing the state’s “Rajasthan Green Credit Policy”.
- Under this initiative, companies and urban local bodies (ULBs) investing in eligible green projects in Rajasthan will receive **tradeable Green Credit Vouchers**.
- Eligible projects include solar/wind power, waste-to-energy, water conservation, pollution control, sustainable agriculture and green buildings.
- The voucher value is generally a percentage of the green investment – initial reports mention slabs around 5–10%, with a maximum benefit of about **₹2.5 crore** per investor/project.
- The vouchers are **tradeable** (can be sold to another entity) and **redeemable** (can be used to adjust/offset state-level incentives in future projects), similar in spirit to carbon credits.
- The initiative complements green incentives under the **Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme 2024 (RIPS‑2024)**, giving additional benefits for environmental investments.
- (Reputed source: DD News cabinet coverage; Free Press Journal – https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/rajasthan-to-give-green-credit-vouchers-for-investment-in-environmental-protection)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- “Green Credit Voucher Initiative‑2025” is a new state policy, likely to be asked in RAS prelims and mains under environment/economy.
- One-liner facts: purpose (green investments), nature (tradeable, redeemable vouchers), approximate cap (~₹2.5 crore), link with RIPS‑2024.
- Excellent example for essays on “green budgeting”, “climate change response”, and “incentive-based environmental governance” in Rajasthan.

**Memory Trick – “Green money, double benefit”**

> Remember: invest in green projects in Rajasthan and you earn once from the project, and once more via a **Green Credit Voucher**.

## TOPIC 3: “Nagauri Ashwagandha” gets GI tag – medicinal identity of Marwar

### What happened?

- The Centre has granted a **Geographical Indication (GI) tag** to **“Nagauri Ashwagandha”**, a well-known medicinal crop from Nagaur (Marwar) in Rajasthan.
- The region’s dry climate and sandy soil are ideal for Ashwagandha cultivation, producing long, thick roots rich in medicinal alkaloids.
- With GI status, the term “Nagauri Ashwagandha” can legally be used only by authorised producers from the Nagaur region.
- The tag gives Nagaur a distinct identity on the global medicinal crop map and provides legal protection against misuse and adulteration of the name.
- This adds another important entry to Rajasthan’s GI list alongside Sojat Mehendi, Bikaneri Bhujia, Makrana Marble, Kota Doria and others.
- (Reputed sources: GKToday – https://www.gktoday.in/centre-grants-gi-tag-to-nagauri-ashwagandha/; UNI India – https://www.uniindia.com/news/north/ashwagandha-gi-tag/3700204.html)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- GI tag questions are common in RAS and other Rajasthan exams – “Nagauri Ashwagandha – Nagaur district – medicinal/agricultural product – Rajasthan” is a classic one-liner.
- Integrates geography (Marwar region), economy (cash/medicinal crop) and culture (traditional Ayurveda).
- Useful in static GK lists on “GI products of Rajasthan”.

**Memory Trick – “Nagaur’s sand, Ashwagandha brand”**

> Visual: dry Marwar soil giving roots of strength – branded as “Nagauri Ashwagandha” after the GI tag.

## TOPIC 4: Crackdown on illegal mining – 552 actions and ₹2.88 crore recovery

### What happened?

- To curb illegal mining in the Aravalli belt and other zones, Rajasthan launched an intensive enforcement drive over a one-week period.
- As per a Times of India report, the state conducted **552 enforcement actions** in just seven days.
- During this period, **76 FIRs** were registered, **17 people arrested** and **over 500 vehicles/equipment** (JCBs, excavators, trucks, tractors etc.) were seized.
- More than **₹2.88 crore** was recovered as penalties and deposited in the state treasury; Jaipur district alone saw 65+ actions, seizure of 2 excavators and dozens of vehicles and over ₹50 lakh in fines.
- Major actions also took place in Bhilwara, Ajmer, Pali, Udaipur, Tonk, Nagaur, Bharatpur and Alwar.
- Officials reiterated a “zero tolerance” stance on illegal mining, warning that any field-level negligence would not be accepted.
- (Reputed source: TOI – https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/state-intensifies-crackdown-on-illegal-mining-and-recovers-over-rs2-88cr-in-a-week/articleshow/126360574.cms)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Illegal mining and Aravalli protection are frequent topics in Rajasthan geography/environment questions.
- Facts like 552 actions, ₹2.88 crore penalty and Jaipur as the district with the highest number of actions are ready-made MCQs.
- Also a strong example for mains answers on “environmental governance”, “resource regulation” and “balancing ecology with development”.

**Memory Trick – “500 vehicles seized, Aravalli eased”**

> Think: one week, 552 actions, 500+ vehicles seized, ₹2.88 crore fine – Rajasthan tightening the grip on illegal mining.

## TOPIC 5: Rajasthan mid-day meal dry ration case – alleged ₹2,000‑crore scam

### What happened?

- On 7 January 2026, the Rajasthan Anti‑Corruption Bureau (ACB) filed a detailed FIR alleging large-scale irregularities in the mid-day meal dry ration scheme during 2020–23.
- The FIR names **21 accused**, including retired officials of the Rajasthan Cooperative Consumer Federation (CONFED) and several private suppliers.
- The allegations relate to supply of dry ration packets (pulses, oil, spices) for students of Classes 1–8, with accusations of inflated pricing, delayed supply, poor quality control and payments without actual delivery.
- The state reportedly spent around **₹2,023.91 crore** on the scheme; ACB estimates that about **₹2,000 crore** is in the zone of suspected loss/misuse.
- This FIR now acts as a “scheduled offence” basis for the **Enforcement Directorate (ED)** to register a money laundering case under the PMLA.
- (Reputed source: Business Standard/PTI – https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/ed-to-file-money-laundering-case-in-2-000-cr-rajasthan-mid-day-meal-scam-126011000549_1.html)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Mid-day meal and school nutrition schemes are regular topics in RAS, REET, teacher recruitment, Patwari and Junior Accountant exams.
- Key data: 2020–23 period, 21 accused, ~₹2,000‑crore alleged scam, 5 phases, over 3 crore students – all are MCQ-friendly facts.
- Provides a Rajasthan-specific example for mains answers on “leakages in welfare schemes” and “issues in public procurement”.
- Also illustrates the role of PMLA and coordination between ED and state ACB in tackling corruption.

**Memory Trick – “3 crore meals, 2,000‑crore deal”**

> Link it: 3+ crore children meant to get meals, but an alleged ₹2,000‑crore misuse – reason for ACB + ED action.

---

## TOPIC 6: Rajasthan Police constable recruitment – 10,000 appointments and paper leak debate

### What happened?

- Shah claimed that the Bhajan Lal government has ended the **“paper leak culture”** in Rajasthan, which he alleged began during the previous Congress regime.
- He cited data that over the last two years overall crime has fallen by about **14%**, serious crimes by 19%, murders by 25% and crimes against women by around 10%.
- The state government has also emphasised that over 200 recruitment exams have been held in its tenure without any paper leak.
- (Reputed sources: ThePrint, PTI and local media – https://theprint.in/india/bhajanlal-govt-ended-paper-leak-culture-started-during-congress-rule-shah/2823880/)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- Police recruitment and law and order are staple topics in Rajasthan Police exams, CET and RAS.
- One-liners: 10,000 new constables, ceremony at Rajasthan Police Academy (Jaipur), phrase “paper leak culture ended” associated with Amit Shah’s speech.
- Also relevant for mains answers on exam reforms, transparent recruitment and youth-related governance issues.

**Memory Trick – “10,000 uniforms, zero leak platform”**

> Visual: a line of 10,000 fresh uniforms on one side, a “No Paper Leak” banner on the other – that’s the exam image.

## TOPIC 7: PM‑KUSUM and Papu Devi of Phalodi – solar-powered empowerment

### What happened?

- A human-interest story from Khara village in Phalodi (Jodhpur division) highlights **Papu/Pappu Devi**, a beneficiary of the **PM‑KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan)** scheme.
- Under PM‑KUSUM, she has set up a solar power plant on her land, converting it into a productive solar asset.
- The regular income from this plant has given her family a stable and predictable earnings source, beyond traditional agriculture.
- IAS officer Arti Dogra wrote on social media how she first met Papu Devi during a Prime Minister’s visit to Banswara; in a more recent interaction Papu confidently discussed technical issues like load, grid sub-station (GSS) and tripping.
- The case is showcased as a symbol of rural women’s empowerment and the transformative impact of decentralised solar power in Rajasthan.
- (Reputed source: NDTV feature – https://www.ndtv.com/feature/how-a-government-scheme-helped-this-rajasthan-woman-power-her-future-10595478; also PM‑KUSUM success stories)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- PM‑KUSUM is a central scheme but Rajasthan is a major implementation state, especially in desert districts – important for RAS, REET and Patwari.
- Combines themes of women’s empowerment, renewable energy, decentralised infrastructure and farmer income diversification – ideal for mains essays.
- Factual MCQs may ask: scheme name (PM‑KUSUM), sector (solar power), and beneficiary state/district (Rajasthan – Phalodi/Jodhpur).

**Memory Trick – “Khara’s rays, Papu’s solar days”**

> Picture: a woman in the Thar desert standing before rows of solar panels – name: Papu Devi, scheme: PM‑KUSUM.

## TOPIC 8: NSO First Advance Estimates – FY26 GDP growth at 7.4%

### What happened?

- The National Statistical Office (NSO) released the **First Advance Estimates of National Income for FY 2025‑26 (FY26)**.
- These estimates project **real GDP growth at 7.4%** for FY26, higher than the roughly 6.5% growth recorded in FY25.
- Services are expected to grow around 9%, manufacturing and construction around 7%, and agriculture around 3%.
- With this projection, India retains its tag as the **world’s fastest-growing major economy**, despite global headwinds.
- (Reputed sources: Deccan Herald, Forbes India etc. reporting NSO estimates; for exams, MOSPI/NSO’s official press note should be treated as the final reference.)

### Why is this important for Rajasthan exams?

- GDP growth numbers are standard questions in all major state exams including RAS, Rajasthan banking and Police.
- Also provides a macroeconomic context for Rajasthan’s own state finances, budget and planning-related questions.

**Memory Trick – “From 6.5 to 7.4 – India’s new score”**

> Short line: FY25 around 6.5%, FY26 estimate 7.4 – remember the jump to keep India as the fastest-growing major economy.
