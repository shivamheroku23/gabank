## TOPIC 1: Indian Banks – Q3 FY26 Credit vs Deposit Growth, CD Ratio

### What happened?

- As per leading brokerage / research reports (Jan 2026 coverage) for **Q3 FY26 (Oct–Dec 2025)**:  
  - Scheduled commercial banks’ **credit growth is estimated at ~12% YoY** and around 4.5% QoQ.  
  - **Deposit growth is around 9.7% YoY** – clearly lower than credit.  
  - The system‑wide **credit–deposit (CD) ratio has risen to around 81%+**, close to an all‑time high.  
- Margin (NIM) pressure had emerged in 2025 after RBI rate cuts, but now:  
  - In Q3, **NIMs are expected to be largely stable with only ~5 bps of decline**.  
  - On the asset‑quality side, **GNPAs remain low and stable** (consistent with Fitch/SBI data).

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Key approximate numbers to remember:  
  - Credit growth: **~12% YoY**, Deposit growth: **~9.7% YoY**, CD ratio: **~81%+**.  
- Concept angle:  
  - When credit grows faster than deposits, a **funding gap** appears →  
    banks may need to raise deposit rates or borrow from markets.  
  - A high CD ratio implies system‑level **liquidity can be tight**;  
    RBI may need to support via OMOs / liquidity operations.  
- Mains / interview:  
  - “Explain why slower deposit growth relative to credit growth is a key risk for Indian banks in 2026.”

### Memory Trick – “12 vs 10 – CD 81”

> One line: **“Credit ~12, deposits under 10 (~9.7), CD above 81.”**  
> Encodes fast credit, slower deposits and a high CD ratio.

## TOPIC 2: SBI Ecowrap – FY26 GDP 7.5% (Upward Bias)

### What happened?

- The **State Bank of India – Economic Research Department** in its **Ecowrap** report has estimated that:  
  - **India’s real GDP growth in FY 2025‑26 (FY26) will be around 7.5%**, with an **upward bias**.  
- Comparison:  
  - **NSO First Advance Estimate:** real GDP growth of about **7.4%**.  
  - **RBI projection:** around **7.3%**.  
- Ecowrap’s point:  
  - When the GDP series is rebased to base year **2022‑23**, measured growth could come out slightly higher.  
  - **Nominal GDP growth is projected at around 8%**.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Direct data points:  
  - SBI Ecowrap → **7.5%**, NSO → **7.4%**, RBI → **7.3%** (FY26 real GDP growth).  
- Macro link:  
  - Higher growth → stronger credit demand → **loan‑growth opportunity** for banks.  
  - Nominal growth of ~8% matters for **tax collections, fiscal math, bank profitability**.  
- Mains:  
  - “How does India’s FY26 growth outlook (as per SBI/RBI/NSO) support a healthy banking credit cycle?”

### Memory Trick – “7.3–7.4–7.5 Ladder”

> Visualise a short ladder:  
> **RBI 7.3, NSO 7.4, SBI 7.5** – three steps, all above 7.

## TOPIC 3: Axis Finance “Vyapar Business Loan” – Collateral‑Free MSE Funding

### What happened?

- **Axis Finance Ltd (AFL)** – the NBFC arm of Axis Bank – has, as per media reports in **January 2026**, announced a product called **“Vyapar Business Loan”**:  
  - Target: **micro &amp; small enterprises (MSEs)** – small shopkeepers, traders, service providers, small manufacturers.  
  - **Collateral‑free business loan** – no property or other security required.  
  - Focus use‑cases: **working capital**, **shop renovation/expansion**, **equipment or inventory purchase**.  
- Ticket size (as per current‑affairs sources):  
  - Some reports indicate **collateral‑free loans up to about ₹10 lakh** under the Vyapar label  
    (Axis Finance website currently lists a generic “Business Loan up to ₹50 lakh”;  
    so treat the ₹10 lakh Vyapar number as an approximate CA figure).

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- MSE financing is a core part of **Priority Sector Lending (PSL)**.  
- Collateral‑free loans:  
  - Crucial for financial inclusion, but **credit appraisal becomes more difficult** →  
    banks/NBFCs must rely more on **cash‑flow‑based lending, GST data and bank‑statement analytics**.  
- Mains / interview:  
  - “What challenges do lenders face in collateral‑free MSME lending and how can data‑based underwriting help?”

### Memory Trick – “Vyapar = unsecured support for small business”

> Line: **“Vyapar loan – unsecured support for small vyaparis, up to ~₹10 lakh.”**

## TOPIC 4: 10 January 2026 – Second Saturday Bank Holiday &amp; Digital Alternatives

### What happened?

- As per the RBI holiday framework, **2nd and 4th Saturdays of every month** are  
  **public holidays for scheduled commercial bank branches** across India.  
- **10 January 2026** fell on a **Saturday** and was the **second Saturday** of the month; so:  
  - **Public/private/foreign bank branches were closed**,  
  - ATMs and digital channels (net banking, mobile banking, UPI, IMPS) worked normally.  
- Since state‑specific holidays sometimes coincide, news portals explicitly highlighted  
  “banks are closed today (10 January 2026)” to avoid confusion.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Static + practical:  
  - Banks are **open on 1st &amp; 3rd Saturdays** and **closed on 2nd &amp; 4th Saturdays** (unless otherwise notified).  
- Interview angle:  
  - “How do digital channels ensure continuity of basic banking services on branch holidays?”

### Memory Trick – “2–4 closed, 1–3 open”

> Simple code: **“On Saturdays, 1 &amp; 3 open, 2 &amp; 4 closed.”**  
> 10 January 2026 = second Saturday → branches closed, digital open.

## TOPIC 5: SBI Card &amp; HDFC – Domestic Airport Lounge Rules from 10 Jan 2026

### What happened?

- **SBI Card – New Domestic Lounge Programme (effective 10 Jan 2026):**  
  - A **revised domestic airport lounge access programme** applies to selected SBI credit cards.  
  - Lounges are grouped into **Set A** and **Set B**; which set you can access depends on your card variant.  
  - Entry process: at the lounge gate you must **swipe/tap your SBI credit card**:  
    - On **Visa / RuPay** cards, a **₹2 non‑refundable validation charge** is levied.  
    - On **Mastercard**, a **₹25 temporary hold** is placed (not actually debited).  
  - Each card has a **fixed complimentary‑visit quota**; beyond that,  
    customers must **pay normal lounge charges** for entry.  

- **HDFC Bank – Debit Card Lounge Access Changes (from 10 Jan 2026):**  
  - HDFC announced that **from 10 Jan 2026, debit cards cannot be directly swiped at lounges for free access**.  
  - New process:  
    - First, you must **spend at least ₹10,000 in a quarter** on your HDFC debit card.  
    - After you qualify, the bank sends an **SMS/Email with a lounge‑voucher link** (within about 2 working days).  
    - You must **claim the voucher**, then use that voucher for lounge entry.  
  - Complimentary visits per quarter depend on card type:  
    - Millennia/Times/GIGA: **1 visit**,  
    - Platinum/Business: **2 visits**,  
    - Infiniti: **4 visits** (as per official terms).

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- In retail banking / card awareness, **airport lounge access, rewards and charges** are frequent topics.  
- Trend:  
  - Lounge access is increasingly **linked to spend conditions and capped free quotas** –  
    banks are trying to **control benefit costs**.  
  - Customers now need **minimum card usage** to retain premium lounge benefits.

### Memory Trick – “Lounge = swipe + spend”

> For SBI Card: **“Swipe for ₹2 test, then rest.”**  
> For HDFC debit: **“Spend ₹10k first, only then voucher is sent.”**
