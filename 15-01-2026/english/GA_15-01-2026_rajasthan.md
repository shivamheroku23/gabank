[Rajasthan Specific Current Affairs]  
## TOPIC 1: Lado‑Type Girl‑Child Incentive Schemes – Higher Amounts &amp; Wider Coverage

### Kya hua?

- Recent state‑level announcements emphasise **strengthening Lado‑type girl‑child incentive schemes** by increasing benefits and expanding coverage.  
- The aim is to revise instalment amounts at milestones like **birth, school admission, board exams and higher education** in line with inflation and rising education costs.  
- Some schemes now provide **higher benefit slabs** for priority categories such as the poor, SC/ST, OBC and single‑mother households.  
- Overall objective is to systematically improve **girl‑child survival, school retention and participation in higher education** across Rajasthan.

### Rajasthan exams ke liye kyun important?

- RAS/REET can directly ask the **core objective of Lado‑type schemes** – financial support for a girl from birth through education.  
- In women‑and‑child‑development answers, you can note that recent revisions **increase benefits and expand coverage** to vulnerable groups.  
- For Police/Patwari exams, knowing **scheme family names and basic purpose** is useful as one‑liners.

**Memory Trick – “Lado 2.0 = more amount, more girls covered”**

> Think of **a bigger piggy bank replacing an old one, being filled with extra coins at every milestone** – that’s the upgraded Lado scheme.

  - **Subsidised LPG cylinders/connections** – safer cooking fuel for women.  
  - **Mahila Nidhi / women‑loan schemes** – soft loans for women self‑help groups (SHGs) and small women entrepreneurs.

## TOPIC 3: Atal Gyan Kendras + Skill Programmes – Youth Pipeline via RSLDC

### Kya hua?

- RAS/Police/Patwari can ask: **What is RSLDC’s role? → Skill development and livelihoods.**  
- In mains answers on youth employment, you can write that **Atal Gyan Kendras + RSLDC training = an integrated youth ecosystem**.  
- For CET/junior exams, Atal Gyan Kendras should be remembered as linked to **digital learning and skills**.
