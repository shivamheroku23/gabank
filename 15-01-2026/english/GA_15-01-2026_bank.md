## TOPIC 1: FEMA (Guarantees) Regulations 2026 – 15-Day Reporting Rule

### What happened?

- RBI notified the **Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) Regulations, 2026**, governing **guarantees involving persons resident outside India**.  
- The regulations require the relevant party (surety, principal debtor or creditor) to **report guarantee details to the authorised dealer (AD) bank within 15 calendar days from the end of each quarter**.  
- AD banks must in turn submit consolidated returns to **RBI within 30 calendar days from the quarter‑end**.  
- Delayed reporting attracts a **Late Submission Fee (LSF)** – a fixed amount plus a small percentage of the guarantee amount, depending on the period of delay.  
- The framework also subsumes separate quarterly reporting for trade‑credit guarantees into this **single unified reporting system**, making monitoring simpler and more traceable.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- MCQs can ask: **FEMA (Guarantees) Regulations 2026 relate to what? → Guarantees under foreign exchange regulations.**  
- For AD banks, this is critical for **compliance, risk monitoring and FX exposure reporting**, especially for **bank guarantees, standby LCs and performance guarantees**.  
- In mains/interviews, you can cite this as an example of RBI moving towards **data‑driven supervision with granular reporting**.

### Memory Trick – “15 + 30 = guarantee‑reporting code”

> Remember: **“15 days from parties to AD bank, 30 days from AD bank to RBI”** – that’s the basic FEMA guarantees reporting formula.

## TOPIC 2: Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2024-25 – Fewer Frauds, Stronger System

- This report is a key source for **banking awareness**; MCQs often ask **who releases it, and what sectors it covers**.  
- In mains you can mention that **fraud incidence (number of cases) is down but amounts remain high**, so risk management, internal controls and technology‑based monitoring stay crucial.

(Official context: Rural development updates on MGNREGA expansion; Photo: https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mgnrega_workers.jpg)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- MGNREGA influences **rural incomes, consumption and informal credit**, which in turn affect banks’ **savings accounts, small‑loan demand and NPA behaviour**.  
- Direct question: **“MGNREGA now proposes how many days of guaranteed work?” → 125 days.**  
- In mains, you can argue that **25 extra days of employment** can boost demand for **FMCG, agri‑inputs and rural banking products**, supporting growth.

### Memory Trick – “MGNREGA: from 100 to 125 – extra safety net”

> Line: **“MGNREGA moves from 100 to 125 – 25 extra days of safety for villages.”**
