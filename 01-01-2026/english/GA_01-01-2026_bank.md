## TOPIC 1: New RBI Digital Banking Framework (From 1 Jan 2026)

### What changed?

- From 1 Jan 2026, for **Internet banking, Mobile banking, USSD, SMS banking, UPI** and other digital channels, banks must:
  - Obtain **special authorisation** and follow **strict conduct rules**.
- Banks must:
  - Take **explicit consent** from the customer before enabling any digital service.
  - Send **alerts** (SMS/Email/Push) for every operation (debit/credit, registration, limit change, etc.).
  - Provide **clear registration / de‑registration (on/off)** options for each channel.
  - Clearly spell out **liability & grievance redressal** in cases of fraud, failed transactions, or unauthorised transactions.
- The framework aims to make digital banking **secure, transparent and accountable**.

### Why important for bank exams?

- RBI’s **new digital banking framework** is direct MCQ material:
  - “From which date did the new digital banking framework come into effect?”
  - “Which services require special authorisation under the new RBI rules?”
- Descriptive/mains:
  - “Write a short note on RBI’s 2026 digital banking authorisation framework (CAAL).”

### Memory Trick – CAAL

**Code word: `CAAL`**

- **C – Consent:**  
  Digital services are not auto‑on; written/digital consent is mandatory.
- **A – Alerts:**  
  For every transaction/activity, SMS/Email/Push alerts – like a “digital CCTV”.
- **A – Access control:**  
  Customer decides:
  - Net banking on/off  
  - Mobile banking on/off  
  - Choice of channel (only mobile, only net, or both)
- **L – Liability & grievance:**  
  Who bears the loss in fraud?  
  In how many days will complaints be resolved?  
  Bank must have a proper grievance redressal system.

**One-line hook:**  
> From 2026, Digital Banking follows **CAAL**: Consent, Alerts, Access, Liability.

## TOPIC 2: BSBD Accounts – Full Digital + Free Services

### What will change?

- **BSBD** = Basic Savings Bank Deposit account (a Jan Dhan–type “no‑frills” account).
- With effect from **1 April 2026** (rule notified around 1 Jan 2026):
  - All banks must provide BSBD holders **full digital banking**:
    - Mobile banking  
    - Internet banking
  - On BSBD accounts:
    - **No minimum balance requirement**  
    - **Free cash deposits** – at branches, ATMs, and business correspondents (BCs)  
    - **Free ATM/Debit card + renewal**  
    - **Minimum cheque book facility free**  
    - **Free account statements**
- Existing customers can **convert their regular account into BSBD** (on request).

### Why important for bank exams?

- BSBD = key pillar of **financial inclusion** – very frequently asked.
- Likely MCQs:
  - “From which date is full digital banking mandatory for BSBD accounts?”
  - “What are the key features of a BSBD account – no minimum balance, free cash deposits, etc.?”

### Memory Trick – “BSBD = 4F”

**Code word: `4F`**

- **F – Full digital** (mobile + net banking)  
- **F – Free deposits** (branch, ATM, BC)  
- **F – Free ATM/debit + basic cheque book/statement**  
- **F – Free from minimum balance** (no minimum balance requirement)

**Line:**

## TOPIC 3: PAN–Aadhaar Linking (From 1 Jan 2026)

### What changed?

- From 1 Jan 2026, if **PAN is not linked with Aadhaar**:
  - PAN can be treated as **inoperative / blocked**.
- Impact:
  - Difficulty in filing Income Tax Returns  
  - Difficulty in opening new bank accounts  
  - Issues in availing loans, credit cards, and many government services
- Banks and government bodies will **strictly check PAN–Aadhaar link status**.

### Why important for bank exams?

- It sits at the intersection of **KYC + tax + banking** – a favourite area.
- Possible questions:
  - “What are the consequences of an inoperative PAN?”
  - “From Jan 2026, why is PAN–Aadhaar linking critical?”

### Memory Trick – “PAN without Aadhaar = LOCK”

- PAN card = **key**, Aadhaar = **handle**.  
- Without the Aadhaar handle, the key cannot open the financial lock.

**Line:**  
> From 2026, if PAN–Aadhaar is not linked, the **financial gate is LOCKED**.

---

## TOPIC 4: Weekly Credit Score Updates (From 1 Jan 2026)

### What changed?

- Earlier: credit scores were updated about **once every 15 days**.
- Now: from 1 Jan 2026, **weekly updates** are mandatory.
- Meaning:
  - If you pay EMIs on time → your **score improves faster**.  
  - If you miss EMIs / default → **negative impact also shows faster**.
- For banks:
  - Loan decisions can be based on **more recent behaviour**.  
  - **Risk assessment becomes more accurate**.

### Why important for bank exams?

- Consumer lending, credit cards, EMIs – all rest on **credit scores**.
- Expected MCQs:
  - “From Jan 2026, how frequently must credit scores be updated at minimum?”
  - “What is the benefit of faster credit score updates – better risk assessment, etc.?”

### Memory Trick – “Sunday Score Report”

- Imagine every **Sunday** as your credit “**Report Card Day**”.  
- The entire week’s behaviour goes into a **new score** shared with banks.

**Line:**  
> Every week, the credit result decides – **good borrower or defaulter**.

---

## TOPIC 5: Credit/Debit Card Rules Change – Lounge, Rewards, Charges

### What changed?

- Large banks (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, IDFC First, etc.) updated **card features**:
  - **Airport lounge access**:
    - Now mostly **linked to minimum spend conditions**.  
    - If the spend target is not met, lounge access is **disabled/limited**.
  - For some categories (like online gaming, wallet loading, etc.):
    - **Additional charges** or **lower reward points**.
  - For many cards:
    - **Overall reward structures trimmed / categories changed**.
- Objective:
  - **Cost control** for banks  
  - Ensuring customers who barely use cards don’t enjoy **premium benefits for free**  
  - Controlling misuse of **high-cost benefits**

### Why important for bank exams?

- In banking awareness, **credit card features, charges, benefits** are regular topics.
- Possible questions:
  - “Why has lounge access been linked to minimum spends?”
  - “Which types of transactions may now attract extra fees or reduced rewards?”

### Memory Trick – “Lounge only if Swipe is high”

- Character: **Lalu – the Lounge Lover**  
- Rule: “Lalu only gets lounge access **if he swipes a lot**.”

**Code:**  
> **LS Rule = Lounge = linked to Spending.**
