## TOPIC 1: UN’s International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists, 2026

### What happened?

- The **UN General Assembly** adopted resolution **A/RES/76/253**, proclaiming **2026 as the “International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP)”**.  
- The resolution was adopted **by consensus** at the **76th UNGA** on **15 March 2022**, led by **Mongolia** with over 60 co‑sponsoring countries.  
- The **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** has been requested to **facilitate implementation** of the IYRP in collaboration with governments and stakeholders.  
- Focus areas: **grazing lands, pastoral communities, livestock-based livelihoods, biodiversity, climate change, food security and rural poverty reduction**.  
  (Official source: UN Digital Library – A/RES/76/253, https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3965711)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- India has a large **pastoral and livestock economy** → important for **priority sector lending** (agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy, allied activities).  
- Banks/NBFCs can support pastoral communities via **KCC, dairy loans, SHG/JLG finance, FPO lending, microfinance** etc.  
- Climate-resilient rangeland and livestock projects link to **green/sustainable finance, ESG and impact investing**.  
- Mains/interview: “How can Indian banks support rangeland and pastoralist communities in the context of IYRP 2026?”

### Memory Trick – “IYRP = Rangelands & Pastoralists”

> Remember: **IYRP → International Year of Rangelands &amp; Pastoralists (2026).**  
> “R + P” in IYRP = Rangelands &amp; Pastoralists.

## TOPIC 2: DRDO’s 12-Minute Scramjet Combustor Test – Hypersonic Boost

### What happened?

- On **9 January 2026**, **DRDO’s Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad** successfully conducted a **long-duration ground test** of a  
  **full-scale actively cooled scramjet combustor/engine**.  
- The test took place at the **Scramjet Connect Pipe Test (SCPT) Facility**, where the scramjet ran **continuously for over 12 minutes** – an exceptional runtime for hypersonic propulsion.  
- The system is being developed for a **future hypersonic cruise missile programme**, designed to operate at **speeds above Mach 5** using air‑breathing propulsion.  
- The Defence Minister and DRDO Chairman described it as a **“path-breaking milestone”** that places India among a **small set of countries** with such advanced hypersonic capabilities.  
  (Official source: PIB – https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2213017)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Progress in hypersonic and defence technology strengthens India’s **indigenous defence industry**, which needs **project finance, working capital and capex lending**.  
- Banks must understand **defence corridors, PSU defence companies and MSME suppliers** as part of their corporate credit universe.  
- Indigenous defence capability can **reduce defence imports**, improving **current account and FX stability**, which is relevant for macro‑economy questions.  
- Science &amp; Tech GA often asks: “Scramjet = **supersonic combustion ramjet**; operates at **hypersonic speeds (Mach &gt; 5)**.”

### Memory Trick – “12 minutes at DRDL, hypersonic milestone”

> One line: **“DRDL Hyderabad – scramjet 12 minutes, hypersonic credit.”**  
> DRDL + 12 min + hypersonic = 3 key hooks.

## TOPIC 3: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication – India’s Road Safety Push

### What happened?

- According to Transport Ministry briefings, India plans to **roll out nationwide Vehicle‑to‑Vehicle (V2V) communication technology by end‑2026** to reduce accidents.  
- V2V uses a **dedicated short‑range wireless module** in vehicles that exchanges **safety-related data** (speed, direction, sudden braking, blind‑spot position, fog conditions etc.)  
  directly between vehicles **without relying on mobile networks or internet**.  
- The system aims to prevent **rear‑end collisions, fog multi‑vehicle pile‑ups and sudden-braking crashes**, especially on highways.  
- Media reports estimate a project cost of roughly **₹5,000 crore**; initially it will apply to **new vehicles**, with retrofitting of existing fleets considered later.  
  (Covered by Deccan Herald, NDTV, GKToday; final details depend on forthcoming official notifications.)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- V2V will reshape the **auto and motor insurance ecosystem** – enabling **telematics-based loans**, usage-based motor insurance and advanced **risk scoring**.  
- New infrastructure and hardware create financing demand across **auto OEMs, component manufacturers, ITS vendors and fleet operators**.  
- Better road safety can, over time, **reduce NPAs in commercial vehicle and logistics portfolios** via fewer accidents and downtime.  

### Memory Trick – “V2V by 2026, ₹5k crore safety fix”

> Think: **“By 2026, V2V nationwide – ~₹5,000 crore for safer highways.”**

## TOPIC 4: RBI Cancels CoR of 35 NBFCs – Regulatory Clean-Up

### What happened?

- The **Reserve Bank of India** issued orders (effective **9–31 December 2025**) cancelling the **Certificates of Registration (CoR) of 35 NBFCs** for **regulatory non‑compliance**;  
  these cancellations have been highlighted in consolidated current affairs in **January 2026**.  
- The action was taken under **Section 45‑IA(6) of the RBI Act, 1934**, which empowers RBI to cancel NBFC registration for non‑compliance with directions.  
- In parallel, **16 other NBFCs voluntarily surrendered their CoR**, which RBI accepted – reasons included **exit from NBFC business, restructuring, or meeting CIC criteria**.  
- After cancellation, these entities **cannot carry on NBFC business** as defined in Section 45‑I(a) of the RBI Act.  
  (Official context: RBI Press Releases on NBFC CoR cancellations – https://rbi.org.in &gt; Press Releases)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Straight facts:  
  - **35 NBFCs – CoR cancelled by RBI for non‑compliance**.  
  - **16 NBFCs – CoR cancelled on voluntary surrender**.  
  - Legal basis → **Section 45‑IA(6), RBI Act 1934**.  
- Highlights RBI’s role in **containing risks from shadow banking**, reducing regulatory arbitrage and protecting depositors/borrowers.  
- Mains/interview: “Why is strong regulation of NBFCs crucial for India’s credit system and financial stability?”

### Memory Trick – “35 cancelled, 16 surrendered, 45‑IA used”

> Code line: **“35 cancel, 16 surrender – Section 45‑IA, regulator’s thunder.”**

## TOPIC 5: India – First Country to Commercialise Bio‑Bitumen for Roads

### What happened?

- CSIR labs **CRRI (Central Road Research Institute)** and **IIP (Indian Institute of Petroleum)** have developed a **bio‑bitumen technology** using  
  **agricultural residues (crop stubble, agro‑waste) via pyrolysis**.  
- At a technology transfer event on **7 January 2026** in New Delhi, the Road Transport Minister announced that  
  **India has become the first country in the world to bring bio‑bitumen technology to industrial/commercial scale for road construction**.  
- Lab and field trials show that bio‑bitumen can be **blended at around 15–30%** with conventional bitumen without compromising performance;  
  a **100‑m trial stretch** has been laid on the **Jorabat–Shillong Expressway (NH‑40)**.  
- Estimates: even **15% blending** could save about **₹4,500 crore** in foreign exchange annually, and over time help replace imported bitumen worth **₹25,000–30,000 crore**.  
  (Official source: PIB – Bio‑bitumen via pyrolysis tech transfer, https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2212118)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Road infrastructure is a core borrower segment; bio‑bitumen creates scope for **green loans, ESG-linked project finance, and green bonds**.  
- The value chain – **bio‑bitumen plants, pyrolysis units, refineries, logistics, EPC contractors** – will require credit support from banks/NBFCs.  
- Using crop residue reduces stubble burning, tying highways to **climate action and “Waste to Wealth”**, a narrative often used in descriptive answers.

### Memory Trick – “Farm to road – bio‑bitumen mode”

> One line: **“Farm residue to road – India’s world‑first bio‑bitumen code.”**
