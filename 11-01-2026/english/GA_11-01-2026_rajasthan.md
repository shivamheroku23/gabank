## TOPIC 1: Jaipur FRRO – Visa Extension &amp; Foreign Tourist Facilitation

### Kya hua?

- From 2026, a **Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)** has begun functioning in **Jaipur**, meaning foreign tourists no longer need to go to Delhi for many visa services.  
- The Jaipur FRRO can now handle **visa extensions, visa conversions (e.g., tourist to medical), exit permissions and certain OCI-related interviews/registrations** for foreigners staying in Rajasthan.  
- This is especially helpful for visitors staying longer in the **Jaipur–Jodhpur–Udaipur tourist circuit**, who can complete visa formalities locally.  
- The step is expected to make Rajasthan a more **tourist-friendly and convenient destination** for international travellers.

### Why important for Rajasthan exams?

- Direct one-liner: **FRRO Jaipur** – new centre for visa extension and foreigner registration in Rajasthan.  
- In governance and tourism answers, the Jaipur FRRO is a good example of **“ease of doing tourism” and localised service delivery**.  
- For police/administration exams, it matters in the context of **foreigner monitoring, visa rules and coordination with security agencies**.

**Memory Trick – “Visa work now in Jaipur, not Delhi”
