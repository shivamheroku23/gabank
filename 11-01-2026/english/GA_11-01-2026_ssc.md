## TOPIC 1: International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP) 2026

### What happened?

- The **UN General Assembly** adopted resolution **A/RES/76/253**, proclaiming **2026 as the “International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP)”**.  
- The resolution was adopted **by consensus on 15 March 2022** during the 76th session of the UNGA, with **Mongolia** taking the lead and many co‑sponsoring countries.  
- The **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** has been designated to **facilitate implementation** of the IYRP in cooperation with governments and civil society.  
- The Year recognises the importance of **grazing lands and pastoral communities** for **biodiversity, climate, food security, rural economies and cultural heritage**.

### SSC exam points:

- International Year 2026 → **International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (IYRP)**.  
- Proclaimed by → **UN General Assembly**, resolution **A/RES/76/253**.  
- Coordinating agency → **FAO**.

## TOPIC 2: DRDO’s 12-Minute Scramjet Test – Hypersonic Technology

### What happened?

- On **9 January 2026**, **DRDO’s Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad** carried out a **long-duration ground test** of a  
  **full-scale actively cooled scramjet combustor/engine**.  
- The test was conducted at the **Scramjet Connect Pipe Test (SCPT) Facility**, where the scramjet ran **continuously for over 12 minutes** – a record-length runtime for such systems.  
- The combustor is being developed for **future hypersonic cruise missiles** intended to fly at **speeds above Mach 5** using air‑breathing scramjet propulsion.  
- The achievement has been hailed as a key milestone taking India closer to joining a **small club of countries** with advanced hypersonic missile technology.

### SSC exam points:

- Lab/location → **DRDL, Hyderabad (DRDO)**.  
- Propulsion type → **scramjet = supersonic combustion ramjet**, operates at **hypersonic speeds (Mach &gt; 5)**.  
- Test duration → **12+ minutes** continuous run.  
- Used for → **hypersonic cruise missile programme**.

**Memory Trick – “DRDL 12 min = hypersonic win”**

> Code: **DRDL + 12 minutes + hypersonic** – three facts in one line.

## TOPIC 3: India’s First Indigenous Commercial Quantum Computer – IIIT Dharwad

### What happened?

- Karnataka’s IT/BT Minister has announced that **India’s first indigenously built commercial quantum computer** will be **deployed at IIIT Dharwad**.  
- The system is being developed in partnership with Bengaluru-based deep-tech startup **QpiAI**, under a new **Centre of Excellence in Quantum AI and Computing**.  
- In the first phase, the system will have around **25 qubits**, with a target to scale up to roughly **1,000 qubits over 2–3 years**, according to media reports.  
- It is intended for applications in **quantum computing and AI**, including **cryptography, optimisation, logistics, materials research and scientific computing**.

### SSC exam points:

- “First indigenous commercial quantum computer” location → **IIIT Dharwad, Karnataka**.  
- Industry/startup partner → **QpiAI**.  
- Qubit roadmap → about **25 qubits initially**, target **~1,000 qubits** in a few years.  
- Use-cases → cryptography, optimisation, AI/ML, advanced simulations.

**Memory Trick – “Dharwad = India’s quantum start”**

> Remember: **“Quantum commercial start – at IIIT Dharwad.”**

## TOPIC 4: Kalpetta, Wayanad – India’s First Fully Paperless District Court

### What happened?

- **Kalpetta** in **Wayanad district, Kerala** has become home to **India’s first fully paperless district court**.  
- The system was formally inaugurated in early January 2026, with **Chief Justice of India Surya Kant** launching the paperless courts virtually from the Kerala High Court.  
- At Kalpetta, all stages of a case – **filing, scrutiny, hearings, evidence, orders and judgments** – are handled through a **completely digital workflow**, without physical files.  
- The initiative is being projected as a step towards **“green jurisprudence”** and a model for court digitalisation across India.

### SSC exam points:

- India’s first fully paperless district court → **Kalpetta, Wayanad (Kerala)**.  
- Inaugurated by → **Chief Justice of India Surya Kant**.  
- Significance → digital, eco‑friendly, efficient court processes.

**Memory Trick – “Kalpetta Court = Paperless Court”**

> One line: **“Kalpetta in Wayanad – India’s first fully paperless district court.”**
