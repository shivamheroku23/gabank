# Cooperative Banking – Structure and History (India)

Ye file India me **cooperative banking** ka history, structure, features aur exam points ko simple Hinglish me cover karti hai.

---

## 1. Cooperative Banking – Basic Idea

Cooperative banks **“cooperation” principle** par based hote hain:

- “**One member, one vote**” – shareholding ke size se voting power change nahi hota.  
- Objective: **profit maxmisation nahi**, balki **mutual help & service to members**.  
- Members = borrowers + depositors (same community / area / occupation).

Cooperative banks mainly:

- Rural (agriculture & allied activities)  
- Urban (small traders, salaried class, small businesses)  

ko banking service provide karte hain.

## 2. Short History – Cooperative Movement in India

### 2.1 Early Cooperative Credit Laws

- **19th century ke end** me rural indebtedness bahut high thi –  
  - farmers moneylenders par dependent the.  
- Is problem ko address karne ke liye Govt ne **cooperative model** introduce kiya.

Key historical milestones (concept level):

1. **Early Cooperative Credit Societies Act (1900s era)**  
   - Village level primary credit societies create karne ke liye legal base.  

2. **Later Cooperative Societies Act (1910s era)**  
   - Cooperatives ka scope widen hua (non‑credit, multi‑purpose societies etc.).  

(Exam year ke liye exact Act names & years – jaise 1904, 1912 – ko aap separate law notes me detail se yaad rakh sakte ho.)

### 2.2 Post‑Independence Developments

- Five Year Plans me cooperative credit ko strong karne par focus:  
  - agriculture, rural development ke liye.  
- Different committees (All India Rural Credit Survey etc.) ne recommend kiya ki:
  - cooperative structure ko **three‑tier** pattern me organise kiya jaye (state, district, primary).  

> Exam line: Cooperative movement ka main aim – **rural poor ko cheap institutional credit** dena and moneylender dependence reduce karna.

## 3. Cooperative Banking Structure – Rural Side (Three‑Tier Model)

Rural cooperative credit structure generally three tiers me explain ki jaati hai:

### 3.1 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)

- **Grass‑root level** unit – village / group of villages level par.  
- Members = local farmers, rural households.  
- Main functions:
  - Short‑term crop loans,  
  - consumption credit,  
  - fertiliser / seeds supply, etc.  
- PACS usually **cooperative banks nahi, but credit cooperatives** hote hain –  
  - fir bhi rural cooperative credit ki base institution.

### 3.2 District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs)

- District level institutions.  
- Member societies = PACS + sometimes individuals.  
- Role:
  - PACS ko refinance / credit provide karna,  
  - district level pe deposits lena, loans dena.

### 3.3 State Cooperative Banks (StCBs / SCBs)

- State level apex cooperative banks.  
- Member institutions = DCCBs, other cooperatives.  
- Role:
  - entire state ke cooperative credit structure ka apex,  
  - NABARD etc. se refinance le kar DCCBs ko onward lending.

Ye 3‑tier structure ko hi hum **short‑term cooperative credit structure** ke roop me dekhte hain.

## 4. Long‑Term Cooperative Credit – Land Development / Agriculture & Rural Development Banks

Rural credit me ek **long‑term cooperative structure** bhi develop hua:

- **State Cooperative Agriculture & Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs)**  
  - ya earlier Land Development Banks (LDBs) etc.  
- Role:
  - Long‑term loans (land development, irrigation, farm investment etc.) provide karna.  

Exam me mostly conceptual level pe hi poocha jata hai ki:

- short‑term cooperative credit structure vs long‑term structure me kya difference hai.

---

## 5. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)

- **Urban & semi‑urban areas** me small savers, salaried class, small traders, small industries, self‑employed logon ko serve karte hain.  
- Features:
  - Cooperative principle (one member, one vote),  
  - but area of operation urban / semi‑urban.  
- Services:
  - Savings / current accounts,  
  - small loans (personal, business),  
  - micro & small business credit.

Exam me UCBs ke liye important:

- Classification by area of operation,  
- regulatory framework (RBI + registrar of cooperatives / central registrar),  
- recent reforms / issues.

---

## 6. Dual Control / Regulation – RBI + Registrar

Cooperative banks ka regulation **dual control** ke under aata hai:

- **RBI / NABARD side (banking functions ke liye):**
  - Banking Regulation Act ke certain provisions,  
  - licensing, prudential norms, CRR/SLR, inspection etc.  
- **Registrar of Cooperative Societies (State / Central):**
  - Co‑operative laws ke under registration, management, elections, audit etc.

Is dual control structure ki wajah se:

- kai baar governance issues, timely corrective action me difficulties aayi –  
  - isliye time‑to‑time reforms / amendments propose hue.

(Exam ke liye, current framework – kaun se cooperative banks par RBI ka full control, kaun par dual – ye latest law amendments se check karo.)

## 7. Strengths & Weaknesses of Cooperative Banking (Conceptually)

### 7.1 Strengths

- **Local knowledge:**
  - Members local hote hain, borrowers ko personally jaante hain.  
- **Financial inclusion:**
  - Remote / rural / small urban borrowers ko service.  
- **Member ownership:**
  - Borrowers & depositors dono hi members; relationship stronger.

### 7.2 Weaknesses / Challenges

- **Weak governance & politics:**
  - Local politics, board interference, professional management ki kami.  
- **Capital constraints:**
  - Share capital limited, capital raising difficult.  
- **NPA & risk management issues:**
  - Proper credit appraisal, monitoring weak ho sakti hai.  
- **Dual control:**
  - RBI + Registrar ke beech coordination challenges.

Isliye recent years me:

- regulatory framework strengthen karne,  
- UCBs ke restructuring / consolidation,  
- PACS modernisation & computerisation  

jaise reforms chal rahe hain.

## 8. Exam Special One‑Liners – Cooperative Banking

1. Cooperative banks **“one member, one vote”** principle par based hote hain.  
2. Objective – **service & mutual help**, not pure profit maximisation.  
3. Rural cooperative credit structure – **three‑tier**:
   - PACS (village level),  
   - DCCBs (district level),  
   - State Cooperative Banks (state level).  
4. Long‑term cooperative credit – **Land Development / Agriculture & Rural Development Banks**.  
5. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) – urban/small town areas me small depositors, traders, salaried class ko serve karte hain.  
6. Cooperative banks ka regulation **dual control** me – RBI/NABARD + Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

## 9. Memory Tricks – Cooperative Banking

**Trick 1 – “P–D–S = 3 Floor ki Co‑op Building”**

Rural cooperative structure ko building samjho:

- Ground floor – **P**ACS (Primary societies)  
- Middle floor – **D**CCB (District Central Cooperative Bank)  
- Top floor – **S**tate Cooperative Bank  

**Trick 2 – “1 Man 1 Vote – Co‑op Note”**

- Cooperative = **“1 man 1 vote”**, chahe kitne bhi shares ho –  
  ise yaad rakhne ke liye line:  
  **“1 man 1 vote – that’s the cooperative note.”**

Aap is file ke saath:

- specific state‑wise examples,  
- key committees on cooperatives,  
- recent UCB reforms,  
ko separate detailed notes me add kar sakte ho, jo exam year ke hisaab se update hote rahen.
