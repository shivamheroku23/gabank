**Trick 1 – “R–B–D–N–S–P–F–I–S”**

- **R** – RBI Act → **RBI**  
- **B** – Banking Regulation → **Banks** regulation by RBI  
- **D** – DICGC Act → **Deposits** insurance  
- **N** – NABARD / NHB Acts → **Niche** development institutions (rural/housing)  
- **S** – SARFAESI → **Secured assets** enforcement  
- **P** – PSS Act → **Payments** systems  
- **F** – FEMA → **Forex** management  
- **I** – IBC → **Insolvency**  
- **S** – SEBI Act → **Securities** market

**Trick 2 – “RBI + RBI ke doston ka Act”**

- RBI Act – central bank,  
- Banking Regulation – banks ka rulebook,

- NABARD/NHB – development friends,  
- SARFAESI/IBC – recovery & resolution tools,
