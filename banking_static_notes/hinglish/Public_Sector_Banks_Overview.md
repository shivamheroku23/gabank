  1. **SBI (State Bank of India)** – alag statute ke under established.

> Simple line: “PSBs = Government majority ownership wale commercial banks”.

  jaisi questions aate hain.

    - recent mergers,  
    - before–after structure,  
    - HQ, taglines, etc. list ho.

**Trick 1 – “PSB = Public ki Sarkari Bank”**

- Public = log

Isse yaad rahega ki majority ownership Government ke paas hai.

**Trick 2 – “3 F – Financial inclusion, Fiscal schemes, Farmers ke liye”**

PSBs ke 3 simple F:

- **Financial Inclusion**  
- **Fiscal Schemes** (Govt ke schemes)  
- **Farmers & priority sector**
