## 12. Memory Tricks – History Flow

**Trick 1 – “H-B-B-M-I-R-S-N-R-N-D”**

Is short code se major milestones yaad rakho:

- **H** – Hindustan Bank (Bank of Hindustan)  
- **B** – Bank of Bengal  
- **B** – Bank of Bombay  
- **M** – Bank of Madras  
- **I** – Imperial Bank of India

- **N** – NABARD / NHB  
- **D** – Digital reforms (UPI, etc.)

**Trick 2 – “3P–I–R–S–N–R–F–D” (Story style)**

- 3P = **3 Presidency banks**  
- I = **Imperial Bank**  
- R = **RBI**  
- S = **SBI**  
- N = **Nationalisation**  
- R = **RRBs / Rural institutions**  
- F = **Financial sector reforms (Narsimham)**  
- D = **Digital banking era**

---

## 13. Cooperative Banking Movement – Short History

- **Early 20th century** me rural credit crisis ko address karne ke liye cooperative philosophy introduce hui.  
- Cooperative credit societies ke liye important laws (jaise 1904 & 1912 ke cooperative Acts) aaye –  
  exact year‑wise Acts aap apne legal history notes me detail me likh sakte ho.  
- Structure gradually develop hua:
  - village level societies,  
  - district / central cooperative banks,  
  - state cooperative banks.  
- Aim:
  - farmers, artisans, rural poor ko **mutual help** principle pe cheap credit dena.  
- Later:
  - Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) bhi aaye – small traders, salaried class ke liye.  
- Aaj:
  - Cooperative banks dual regulatory framework ke under aate hain (RBI + state registrars etc., time ke hisaab se framework evolve hota rehta hai).

> Exam angle: “Cooperative banking movement – rural credit ko institutional form dene ka early attempt.”

---

## 14. Deposit Insurance & DICGC – Depositors ka Protection

- 1960s ke bank failures ne dikhaya ki small depositors ko protection ki zarurat hai.  
- Is context me ek **deposit insurance corporation** banaya gaya (DICGC) –  
  - jiska kaam scheduled banks ke deposits ko ek certain limit tak insure karna hai.  
- DICGC aaj **RBI ki wholly owned subsidiary** hai.  
- Key points (exam style):
  - All commercial banks, RRBs, eligible cooperative banks ke deposits cover hote hain (exceptions alag se).  
  - Har depositor ko per bank ek **maximum insured amount** tak protection milta hai –  
    exact limit exam year ke hisaab se latest official notification se verify karo.  

> Yaad rakho: “Deposit insurance = DICGC, RBI ke umbrella ke andar, small depositors ki safety ke liye.”

---

## 15. Priority Sector Lending (PSL) & Financial Inclusion – History Snapshot

- **1960s–70s:**  
  - Realise hua ki banking credit mostly large industry tak limited hai;  
    agriculture, MSME, weaker sections ko kam finance mil raha hai.  
- RBI ne **Priority Sector Lending (PSL)** concept introduce kiya –  
  - banks ko kuch sectors me **minimum % of ANBC / OBE** ke hisaab se credit dena mandatory.  
- Major priority sectors (concept level):
  - Agriculture, MSMEs, Export credit, Education, Housing (certain limits),  
  - Social infrastructure, Renewable energy, Weaker sections, etc.  
- PSL norms time ke sath revise hote rahe –  
  - targets, sub‑targets (jaise small & marginal farmer, micro enterprise),  
  - aur new categories add / refine ki gayi.

> Exam me: PSL ka concept, major sectors, aur term “priority sector lending target” bahut important hai.

---

## 16. Capital Adequacy & Basel Norms – India me Adoption

- 1980s ke end / 1990s se international level par **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision** ne capital standards (Basel I, II, III) issue kiye.  
- India ne inko adopt kiya:
  - **Basel I** – basic credit risk based capital norms.  
  - **Basel II** – three pillars (minimum capital, supervisory review, market discipline).  
  - **Basel III** – global financial crisis ke baad, stronger capital + liquidity standards.  
- RBI ne phased manner me Indian banks par Basel guidelines implement karvai –  
  - capital adequacy ratio, Tier I / Tier II capital, leverage ratio, liquidity coverage ratio, etc.

> Static yaad rakhna: “Basel norms = international capital standards; India me RBI ne 1990s se phased adoption start ki.”

---

## 17. NPA Resolution Framework – DRT, SARFAESI, IBC (High Level)

Banks ke badhte **Non‑Performing Assets (NPAs)** handle karne ke liye alag‑alag legal tools aaye:

- **Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs):**  
  - Special tribunals jahan banks / FIs apne large loan recovery cases faster dispose karwa sakein.  

- **SARFAESI Act (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest):**  
  - Secured creditors (banks / FIs) ko certain conditions me **court ke bina** secured asset par possession / sale ka right deta hai.  
  - Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) ka concept introduce.  

- **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC):**  
  - Corporate borrowers ke liye **time‑bound resolution framework**.  
  - Creditor‑driven insolvency process, insolvency professionals, committees of creditors, NCLT etc. ka system.  

> Exam angle: Ye sab legal developments banking history ka part hain kyunki inhone loan recovery aur NPAs handling ka pura model change kar diya.

---

## 18. New Types of Banks – Payment Banks & Small Finance Banks

- Financial inclusion & competition ke liye RBI ne **2010s** me new category ke banks introduce kiye:

### 18.1 Payments Banks

- Objective:
  - small deposits + payments / remittance services.

- Features:
  - full fledged small bank,  
  - higher share of loans to priority & small ticket borrowers,  
  - certain PSL norms specially stringent.

> Exam me mostly: definition, objectives, basic features, examples of payments/SFBs pooche jate hain.

---

## 19. Microfinance & SHG–Bank Linkage – Rural Banking ka Important Chapter

- Rural poor, especially women groups ke liye **Self Help Group (SHG)–Bank Linkage Programme** ek major innovation tha.  
- NABARD ke leadership me banks ne SHGs ko:
  - group savings,  
  - internal lending,  
  - phir formal bank se credit linkage ke through empower kiya.  
- Micro‑finance institutions (MFIs) bhi later develop hue –  
  - small loan amounts, group lending models, door‑step service.

> History angle: “Formal banking + SHGs + MFIs ke mix se rural credit delivery system ka naya model bana.”
