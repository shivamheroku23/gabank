# Types of Banks in India – Static Notes (English)

This file explains the **main types and classifications of banks in India** in an exam‑oriented way –  
so you can clearly identify “which bank belongs to which category”.

---

## 1. Broad Classification – Think in 3 Angles

It is easiest to remember bank types by three angles:

1. **By Ownership**
   - Public Sector Banks (PSBs)  
   - Private Sector Banks  
   - Foreign Banks  

2. **By Function / Role**
   - Central Bank – **RBI**  
   - Commercial Banks (Scheduled / Non‑Scheduled)  
   - Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)  
   - Cooperative Banks  
   - Development Banks / Financial Institutions (NABARD, SIDBI, EXIM, NHB, etc.)  

3. **By Special Category**
   - Payments Banks  
   - Small Finance Banks (SFBs)  
   - Local Area Banks (LABs – concept)  
   - Other specialised institutions (e.g. EXIM Bank, housing finance apex institutions)

> Memory trick: **“O–F–S = Ownership, Function, Special”** – remember these 3 angles first.

## 2. Central Bank – RBI (Separate File)

- **RBI – Reserve Bank of India** is India’s **central bank / monetary authority**.  
- It is covered in detail in `RBI.md`.  
- For exams, remember: there is **only one central bank** in India – RBI.

---

## 3. Commercial Banks

Commercial banks primarily:

- accept **deposits** from the public,  
- extend **loans and advances**,  
- provide payment and remittance services.

### 3.1 Scheduled vs Non‑Scheduled Banks

**Scheduled Banks:**

- Included in the **Second Schedule of the RBI Act, 1934**.  
- Conditions (concept level):
  - Minimum paid‑up capital and reserves as per RBI norms,  
  - Business not conducted in a manner prejudicial to depositors or public interest.  
- Eligible for certain facilities:
  - refinance from RBI,  
  - membership of clearing houses,  
  - other privileges.

**Non‑Scheduled Banks:**

- Not included in the Second Schedule; generally smaller and with fewer privileges.

### 3.2 Public Sector Banks (PSBs)

- Commercial banks where **majority shareholding** is with the Government of India / State Governments (usually 51%+).  
- Examples include SBI and other nationalised banks (exact list is dynamic; check for exam year).  
- Main roles:
  - financial inclusion,  
  - priority sector lending,  
  - implementation of Government schemes,  
  - large branch network.

### 3.3 Private Sector Banks

- Commercial banks where majority ownership lies with **private shareholders**.  
- Categories:
  - Old private sector banks  
  - New private sector banks (post‑reforms).  
- Known for:
  - technology adoption,  
  - retail products,  
  - profit and efficiency focus.

### 3.4 Foreign Banks

- Banks with Head Office outside India, operating in India through branches / subsidiaries.  
- Regulated by RBI and home‑country regulators.

## 4. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)

- Established under the **Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976**.  
- Objective:
  - provide banking services and credit to **small & marginal farmers, rural labourers, artisans and small entrepreneurs** in rural areas.

- Ownership structure (typical pattern – exam year for exact ratio):
  - Central Government + State Government + Sponsor Bank (a PSB).

- Focus:
  - agricultural and rural credit,  
  - implementation of rural Government schemes.

(You can create a separate file `Regional_Rural_Banks_RRBs.md` for detailed lists and amalgamations.)

---

## 5. Cooperative Banks

- Based on cooperative principles – **“one person, one vote”** and service motive.  
- Strong presence in rural and semi‑urban areas; also **Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)** in cities.

Rural short‑term cooperative credit structure (simplified):

- Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) – village level  
- District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) – district level  
- State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) – state level  

Regulation:

- Often under **dual control** – RBI/NABARD (for banking functions) and State/Central Registrars (for cooperative law aspects).

(For more detail see `Cooperative_Banking_Structure_and_History.md`.)

## 6. Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) / Specialised Banks

These institutions focus on long‑term development:

- **NABARD** – agriculture & rural development finance.  
- **SIDBI** – MSME & small industries finance.  
- **EXIM Bank** – export‑import finance.  
- **NHB** – housing finance system development.

Each has a separate static file (e.g. `NABARD.md`, `SIDBI.md`, `EXIM_Bank.md`, `NHB_National_Housing_Bank.md`)  
covering establishment year, parent Act, ownership, schemes and exam one‑liners.

## 7. Payments Banks

- Concept: banks focusing on **small deposits and payments / remittances**, not on lending.  
- Key features:

  - Maximum deposit per customer capped (as per latest RBI guidelines),  
  - **Not allowed to give loans**,  
  - Provide payment and remittance services plus basic savings.

- Objective:
  - Provide simple banking to unbanked / under‑banked segments – migrant workers, small businesses, low‑income households.

(Separate file `Payments_Banks.md` recommended for list and features.)

## 8. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)

- Objective:
  - serve **small borrowers and underserved segments** – small businesses, micro enterprises, small & marginal farmers, unorganised sector.  

- Features:
  - Full‑service small banks,  
  - Higher PSL norms and focus on small‑ticket loans,  
  - Part of financial inclusion strategy.

(Detailed static can go into `Small_Finance_Banks.md` with list, origins, conversion from MFIs, etc.)

## 9. Local Area Banks (LABs) – Concept

- Small private sector banks operating in a **limited geographic area** (few districts).  
- Aim to mobilise rural savings and provide credit in local areas.
