# SARFAESI – DRT – IBC Overview – Static Notes (English)

This file explains the key **laws for loan recovery and NPA resolution** in India:

- DRT – Debt Recovery Tribunals  
- SARFAESI Act  
- Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)  

---

## 1. Background – NPA Problem & Need for Special Laws

- When borrowers default, bank loans become **NPAs (Non‑Performing Assets)**.  
- Regular civil courts were too slow for recovery cases.  
- To speed up recovery and resolution, special laws and institutions were created:

1. **Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)** – for faster loan recovery.  
2. **SARFAESI Act** – empowers secured creditors to enforce security interest without court.  
3. **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)** – time‑bound corporate insolvency resolution framework.

---

## 2. Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)

### 2.1 Basic Idea

- Objective: to **fast‑track loan recovery cases of banks and financial institutions**.  
- DRTs are special tribunals that handle debt recovery cases above a specified threshold amount.

### 2.2 Legal Base (Concept Level)

- A special Act in the 1990s created:
  - **Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)**, and  
  - **Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals (DRATs)**.  
- Later amendments expanded it into a broader **Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy** framework.

(For exams, note the exact Act name, year and key amendments in a separate law note.)

### 2.3 Key Features

- Banks / FIs can file an Original Application (OA) directly before the DRT.  
- DRT follows summary procedures to provide faster decisions than civil courts.  
- Appeals from DRT orders go to DRAT.

> Exam angle: **DRTs = special tribunals for loan recovery of banks/FIs.**

## 3. SARFAESI Act – Securitisation & Enforcement of Security Interest

### 3.1 Full Form and Purpose

- **SARFAESI:**  
  **Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act**.  

- Objectives:

  - Give secured creditors (banks/FIs) power to **enforce security interest without court intervention** (subject to conditions).  
  - Provide a legal framework for **Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)**.

### 3.2 Key Concepts

1. **Security Interest:**  
   - Any mortgage, charge, lien or hypothecation where the bank has a right over the asset.

2. **Enforcement Without Court:**  
   - When a borrower defaults and the account becomes NPA,  
     the bank can, after giving notice, **take possession of and sell the secured asset** as per the Act.  

3. **Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC):**  
   - Specialised company that acquires NPAs from banks and works on their reconstruction / resolution.  
   - Banks can transfer stressed assets to ARCs to clean their balance sheets (as per RBI norms).

### 3.3 Typical Process (Conceptual)

1. Loan becomes NPA as per RBI norms.  
2. Bank issues a **demand notice** to the borrower under SARFAESI.  
3. If dues are not cleared within the prescribed time:
   - Bank can take **symbolic / physical possession** of secured assets,  
   - sell assets via auction or other authorised methods,  
   - or change management/control in certain cases.  
4. Borrower has limited scope to challenge actions before DRT / courts as per the Act.

### 3.4 Coverage & Limitations

- Primarily applicable to **secured loans**.  
- Certain assets (like agricultural land, small loans, etc.) may have restrictions or exemptions.  
- Detailed thresholds and exclusions are specified in the Act and RBI guidelines.

> Exam line: **“SARFAESI = legal power for secured creditors to enforce security interest without court.”**

## 4. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)

### 4.1 Purpose

- Earlier, insolvency and bankruptcy issues were spread across multiple laws,  
  leading to delays and low recovery.  

- **IBC** aims to provide a **single, time‑bound framework** for:
  - corporate insolvency resolution,  
  - individual and partnership insolvency & bankruptcy (implementation phase‑wise).

### 4.2 Key Features (High Level)

1. **Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP):**  
   - When a corporate debtor defaults beyond a threshold,  
     financial or operational creditors can file an application before **NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal)**.  

   - After admission:
     - Moratorium period (stay on certain actions),  
     - Appointment of an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP),  
     - Formation of a Committee of Creditors (CoC),  
     - Invitation and evaluation of resolution plans.

2. **Time‑Bound Resolution:**  
   - The Code prescribes a **strict time limit** (with limited extensions) for resolution.  

3. **Committee of Creditors (CoC):**  
   - Composed mainly of financial creditors.  
   - Approves or rejects resolution plans through voting (defined majority threshold).

4. **Liquidation:**  
   - If no viable resolution plan is approved within the time limit,  
     the company can be sent into liquidation.  
   - Sale proceeds are distributed as per a **waterfall mechanism**.

5. **Coverage Beyond Companies:**  
   - Framework also exists for individuals and partnerships (phased implementation – see latest status for exams).

### 4.3 Importance of IBC for Banks & NPAs

- Provides banks with a powerful **tool for resolving large NPAs**.  
- Enables going‑concern sale and restructuring under a transparent legal framework.  
- Has improved recovery rates and discipline in corporate borrowing.

> Exam angle: **IBC = time‑bound insolvency & bankruptcy framework involving NCLT, IRP/RP, CoC, and resolution plans.**

## 7. Memory Tricks – SARFAESI, DRT, IBC

**Trick 1 – “D–S–I = Decide, Seize, Insolvent”**

- **D – DRT:**  
  - Tribunal **decides** on recovery cases.  
- **S – SARFAESI:**  
  - Secured creditor **seizes/sells** the asset without court.  
- **I – IBC:**  
  - Company is **insolvent** – undergoes resolution or liquidation.

**Trick 2 – “Court – Less – Code”**

- **Court (DRT)** – special court/tribunal for debt recovery.  
- **Less (SARFAESI)** – **court‑less** enforcement of security interest.  
- **Code (IBC)** – comprehensive **Code** for insolvency and bankruptcy.
