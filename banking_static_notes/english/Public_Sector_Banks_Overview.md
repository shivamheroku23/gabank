# Public Sector Banks (PSBs) – Overview (English)

This file covers the **concept, features and exam‑relevant points** about Public Sector Banks in India.  
The exact list of PSBs, merger details, HQs, taglines etc. are dynamic and should be maintained separately.

## 1. Public Sector Bank – Definition (Exam Style)

- A **Public Sector Bank (PSB)** is a commercial bank in which:

  - the **Government of India and/or State Government together hold a majority stake**  
    (generally 51% or more).  

- PSBs are usually viewed in two broad groups:
  1. **SBI (State Bank of India)** – set up under the SBI Act, 1955.  
  2. **Nationalised / Other Government‑Owned Banks** – created by nationalisation and subsequent amalgamations.

> Simple line: **“PSBs = commercial banks with majority Government ownership.”**

## 2. Role of PSBs in the Indian Economy

- **Backbone of Financial Inclusion:**  
  - Large branch network in rural and semi‑urban areas.  
  - Major channel for PMJDY, DBT, social security schemes (PMJJBY, PMSBY, APY, etc.).

- **Priority Sector Lending:**  
  - Significant share of lending to agriculture, MSMEs, weaker sections, education, housing, etc.

- **Government Business Handling:**  
  - Handle Government receipts and payments, pensions, subsidy transfers, tax collections.

- **Developmental Role:**  
  - Provide credit and support for rural development, infrastructure projects, and flagship Government schemes.

## 3. Key Features of PSBs

- **Ownership & Control:**  
  - Majority shareholding with Government; policy direction often aligned with Government objectives.

- **Branch Network:**  
  - Large presence across the country, especially in rural and semi‑urban areas.

- **Customer Base:**  
  - Large base among farmers, small businesses, Government employees, pensioners and general public.

- **Business Orientation:**  
  - Focus on both profit and **social/developmental goals** like financial inclusion and priority sector lending.

- **Capital Support:**  
  - When needed, Government may recapitalise PSBs (subject to fiscal space and policy).

## 4. PSB Mergers & Consolidation – Concept Only

- In recent years, PSBs have gone through **mergers/consolidation**:

  - Aim – create larger, stronger and more efficient entities.  
  - Reduce duplication and improve capital utilisation.

- Exam questions often ask:

  - “Which bank merged into which anchor bank?”  
  - “After merger, what is the name and HQ of the new bank?”

- Therefore, maintain a separate updated file listing:
  - merger combinations,  
  - effective dates,  
  - HQs and new structures.

## 5. PSBs vs Private Sector Banks – Simple Comparison

| Point              | Public Sector Banks                               | Private Sector Banks                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ownership          | Majority Government ownership                     | Majority private ownership                      |
| Objectives         | Profit + social/developmental objectives          | Profit & efficiency                             |
| Branch Presence    | Strong rural & semi‑urban presence                | Initially urban/metro, now expanding rural      |
| Role in Govt Schemes| Main channel for Government schemes and subsidies | Partial but growing participation               |
| Capital Support    | Can be recapitalised by Government                | Mainly raised through markets / promoters       |

(This is a broad comparison; individual banks can differ.)

## 8. Memory Tricks – PSBs

**Trick 1 – “PSB = Public’s Sarkari Bank”**

- Public = people,  
- Sarkari = Government,  
- Bank = commercial bank.  
Helps recall that PSBs are banks where the Government holds majority shares.

**Trick 2 – “3 F – Financial Inclusion, Fiscal Schemes, Farmers”**

Three key roles of PSBs:

- **Financial Inclusion** – account opening and access for all.  
- **Fiscal Schemes** – implementation of Government fiscal schemes (subsidies, DBT, tax collections).  
- **Farmers & Priority Sector** – providing credit to agriculture and priority sectors.

Use this overview as a base; then read individual PSB profiles (SBI, PNB, BOB, etc.) in separate static notes for exam‑level detail.
