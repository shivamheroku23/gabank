This file covers the **history of banking in India** in a simple, exam‑oriented way –  
from ancient times to modern digital banking, including key years, Acts and committees.

## 1. Ancient & Pre‑Modern Period – Indigenous Banking

### 1.1 Ancient / Pre‑Historic Period

- Along with trade and commerce, **money lending** also developed.  
- Goldsmiths, sahukars, seths, mahajans acted as moneylenders.  
- Traditional instruments such as **promissory notes and hundis** were used – an early form of negotiable instruments.

### 1.2 Indigenous Bankers & Hundis

- **Indigenous bankers** – baniyas, chettiars, marwari financiers, etc.  
- **Hundi:**  
  - Traditional bill of exchange / remittance instrument used by merchants  
    to transfer funds from one city to another.  
- Although the term “bank” was not used, the basic functions of **lending, deposits and remittances** existed.

> Exam point: The base of ancient / medieval banking in India was **indigenous bankers + hundis**.

## 2. Beginning of Modern Banking – Presidency Banks

### 2.1 First Joint‑Stock Bank – Bank of Hindustan

- **Bank of Hindustan (1770)** is considered the first modern‑style bank in India.  
- Later this bank closed, but it is an important exam fact.

### 2.2 Presidency Banks

Three major Presidency Banks were set up in British India:

1. **Bank of Bengal** – 1806  
2. **Bank of Bombay** – 1840  
3. **Bank of Madras** – 1843  

- Operated under the influence of the East India Company.

### 2.3 Imperial Bank of India

- These three Presidency Banks were merged to form the **Imperial Bank of India (1921)**.  
- It functioned as a major commercial bank and as banker to Government / banking system.  
- Later, the Imperial Bank was taken over to form **State Bank of India (SBI)**.

> Memory line: “Bengal 1806, Bombay 1840, Madras 1843 – together become Imperial 1921.”

## 5. Nationalisation Phase – Social Control and PSBs

### 5.1 Social Control (1960s)

- By the 1960s, it was observed that private banks’ credit was concentrated in **large industry / business houses**,  
  while agriculture and rural areas were underserved.

## 6. RRBs and Cooperative Strengthening – 1970s

- Under the **RRB Act, 1976**, **Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)** were set up:
  - Objective – provide institutional credit to small & marginal farmers, rural artisans, landless labourers, etc.

---

## 7. Reforms and Liberalisation – 1990s onwards

### 7.1 Narasimham Committees

## 8. Recent Phase – Consolidation, Inclusion & Digital Banking

### 8.1 PSB Consolidation (Mergers)

- In recent years, the Government initiated **consolidation of PSBs**:
  - Multiple PSBs merged to form larger, stronger banks.  
  - Goals – stronger balance sheets, better capital utilisation, reduced duplication.

(For exams, maintain a separate list of which PSB merged into which “anchor” bank, and when.)

### 8.2 Financial Inclusion Drive

- Movement from **No‑Frills Accounts → Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts → PMJDY (Jan Dhan)**.  
- DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) for subsidies and welfare schemes.  
- Use of Business Correspondents (BCs), micro‑ATMs, banking mitras for last‑mile service.

### 8.3 Digital & Payments Revolution

- Development of **NEFT, RTGS, IMPS**, followed by:
  - **UPI**, **BHIM**, **QR payments**, **BBPS**, **AEPS**, etc.  
- Fintechs, payment banks, small finance banks added new competitive layers.

## 12. Memory Tricks – History Flow

**Trick 1 – “H‑B‑B‑M‑I‑R‑S‑N‑R‑N‑D”**

- **H** – Hindustan Bank (Bank of Hindustan)  
- **B** – Bank of Bengal  
- **B** – Bank of Bombay

- S = **SBI**  
- N = **Nationalisation**  
- R = **RRBs & Rural Institutions**  
- F = **Financial Sector Reforms (Narasimham)**  
- D = **Digital Banking Era**

## 13. Cooperative Banking Movement – Short History

- In the early 20th century, cooperative philosophy was introduced to tackle rural credit problems.  
- Cooperative Acts (e.g. 1904, 1912) provided legal backing for rural credit societies.  
- Gradually the structure evolved:
  - village‑level cooperatives,  
  - district / central cooperative banks,  
  - state cooperative banks.  
- Aim:
  - provide **mutual‑help based cheap credit** to farmers, artisans and rural poor.  
- Later:
  - Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) were created to serve small urban customers.  
- Today:
  - Cooperative banks are under a dual regulatory framework (RBI + state/central registrars), updated through successive amendments.

> Exam angle: “Cooperative banking movement = early attempt to institutionalise rural credit.”

---

## 14. Deposit Insurance & DICGC – Depositor Protection

- Bank failures in the 1960s highlighted the need to protect small depositors.  
- **Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)** was created as a deposit insurance body:
  - provides deposit insurance up to a **maximum insured amount per depositor per bank**.  

- DICGC is now a **wholly owned subsidiary of RBI**.  

Key exam points:

- Covers deposits of commercial banks, RRBs and many cooperative banks (with some exceptions).  
- Exact insured limit must be checked from the latest official notification.

> Remember: “Deposit insurance = DICGC, under RBI, protecting small depositors.”

---

## 15. PSL & Financial Inclusion – Historical Snapshot

- In the 1960s–70s, it was observed that bank credit was concentrated in large industry;  
  agriculture, MSMEs and weaker sections were underserved.  
- RBI introduced **Priority Sector Lending (PSL)**:
  - required banks to lend a minimum percentage of their ANBC to specified sectors.  

- Major PSL sectors (concept level):
  - Agriculture, MSMEs, Export credit, Education, Housing (within limits),  
  - Social infrastructure, Renewable energy, Weaker sections, etc.  

- PSL norms have been revised over time:
  - new targets, sub‑targets (small & marginal farmers, micro enterprises),  
  - new categories added/refined.

> Exam focus: PSL concept, key sectors and terms like “priority sector lending target”.

---

## 16. Capital Adequacy & Basel Norms – Adoption in India

- From the late 1980s / 1990s, the **Basel Committee** introduced Basel I, II, III capital standards.  
- India adopted these via RBI:

  - **Basel I** – basic credit risk‑based capital norms.  
  - **Basel II** – three pillars (capital, supervisory review, market discipline).  
  - **Basel III** – stronger capital and liquidity standards after the global financial crisis.

> Static takeaway: “Basel norms = international capital standards; India’s adoption began in the 1990s under RBI supervision.”

---

## 17. NPA Resolution Framework – DRT, SARFAESI, IBC

To handle rising NPAs, several legal tools were introduced:

- **Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs):**  
  - special tribunals for faster bank debt recovery.  

- **SARFAESI Act:**  
  - enables secured creditors to enforce security interests **without court intervention** (subject to conditions),  
  - introduced Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs).  

- **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC):**  
  - time‑bound corporate insolvency resolution framework,  
  - involving NCLT, insolvency professionals, CoC, etc.

> Exam angle: these laws transformed India’s loan recovery and NPA resolution framework.

---

## 18. New Types of Banks – Payments Banks & Small Finance Banks

- To improve financial inclusion and competition, RBI introduced:

### 18.1 Payments Banks

- Objective:
  - small deposits + payments / remittance services.  
- Features:
  - cap on maximum deposit per customer,  
  - **not allowed to lend**,  
  - focus on payments and remittances.

### 18.2 Small Finance Banks (SFBs)

- Objective:
  - provide formal banking to small borrowers – small businesses, micro enterprises, small & marginal farmers, unorganised sector.  
- Features:
  - full‑service small banks with stricter PSL requirements,  
  - strong focus on small‑ticket loans and underserved segments.

> Exams usually ask definitions, objectives, basic features and examples.

---

## 19. Microfinance & SHG–Bank Linkage – Rural Banking Chapter

- **Self Help Group (SHG)–Bank Linkage Programme** was promoted (led by NABARD) to serve rural poor, especially women.  
- Model:
  - SHGs save regularly, lend internally, and then link with banks for larger credit.  
- Microfinance institutions (MFIs) later emerged:
  - small loans, group lending models, doorstep service.

> Historical angle: “Combination of formal banks + SHGs + MFIs created a new model for rural credit delivery.”
