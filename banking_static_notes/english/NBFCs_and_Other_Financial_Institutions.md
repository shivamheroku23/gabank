# NBFCs and Other Financial Institutions – Static Notes (English)

This file gives a basic overview of **NBFCs (Non‑Banking Financial Companies)**  
and some important financial institutions, plus key exam points and comparisons with banks.

## 1. NBFC – Non‑Banking Financial Company – Definition

- An NBFC is a **company** (registered under the Companies Act) that:

  - provides loans and advances,  
  - invests in shares, stocks, bonds, debentures, securities,  
  - may engage in hire‑purchase, leasing, insurance, chit funds, etc.,  

  but **does not have a full banking licence** like a bank.

- NBFCs are incorporated under the **Companies Act**, and  
  are authorised and supervised by **RBI** (and sometimes other regulators) under the NBFC regulatory framework.

> Simple line: **“NBFC = Not a Bank, but a Finance Company.”**

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| Cheque Facility          | Yes, directly on bank accounts              | No direct cheque facility on NBFC accounts          |
| Payment System Access    | Direct access to RTGS, NEFT, etc.           | Typically indirect via a bank                       |
| Regulation               | RBI as bank regulator                       | RBI as NBFC regulator (+ other sectoral regulators) |
| Deposit Insurance (DICGC)| Eligible deposits covered by DICGC          | Generally not covered by DICGC                      |

## 3. Types of NBFCs – Concept Overview

NBFCs are classified by size, activity, etc.  
Important types (concept level):

1. **NBFC‑Investment and Credit Company (NBFC‑ICC)**  
   - Engaged in loans & advances, investments in securities, etc.

2. **NBFC‑Micro Finance Institution (NBFC‑MFI)**  
   - Specialised in microfinance loans – small‑ticket loans to low‑income borrowers, often with group lending models.

3. **NBFC‑Factor**  
   - Focused on factoring business (financing of receivables).

4. **Infrastructure Finance Company (IFC)**  
   - Specialised NBFCs financing infrastructure projects.

5. **Infrastructure Debt Fund – NBFC (IDF‑NBFC)**  
   - Invest in long‑term debt of infrastructure projects.

6. **CIC – Core Investment Company**  
   - Holding company‑type NBFC – holds investments in group companies; subject to a specific regulatory framework.

(Names / classification may be refined by RBI from time to time – always refer to latest Master Directions.)

## 4. Regulatory Framework for NBFCs (High Level)

- **Registration with RBI:**  
  - NBFCs engaging in specified financial activities above a threshold must obtain RBI registration.

- **Prudential Norms:**  
  - Capital adequacy requirements,  
  - NPA norms and asset classification,  
  - provisioning requirements,  
  - fair practices code,  
  - liquidity norms (e.g., LCR for certain NBFCs).

- **Scale‑Based Regulation:**  
  - NBFCs are grouped into layers (base, middle, upper, top) based on size and systemic importance;  
  - each layer has different regulatory intensity.

## 5. Economic Role of NBFCs

- **Credit Delivery:**  
  - Strong presence in retail loans, MSME loans, vehicle finance, consumer loans, housing loans, microfinance, etc.

- **Last‑Mile Connectivity:**  
  - Serve areas / segments where banks have limited reach.

- **Specialisation:**  
  - Expertise in niche segments – vehicle finance, consumer durables, infrastructure finance, etc.

- **Financial Inclusion:**  
  - NBFC‑MFIs provide microcredit to low‑income households and small borrowers.

## 6. Other Important Financial Institutions (Non‑Bank, But Exam‑Relevant)

### 6.1 Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) – Recap

(See separate static files for details)

- **NABARD** – agriculture & rural development finance.  
- **SIDBI** – MSME and small industries finance.  
- **EXIM Bank** – export‑import finance.  
- **NHB** – apex institution for housing finance.

These institutions focus on long‑term development finance for specialised sectors.

### 6.2 Mutual Funds

- **Structure:**  
  - Operated by an Asset Management Company (AMC);  
  - regulated by **SEBI**;  
  - pool investors’ money to invest in various securities.

- **Link with Banks:**  
  - Many mutual funds are bank‑sponsored;  
  - banks distribute MF schemes to retail customers.

### 6.3 Insurance Companies

- Life insurance – LIC and private life insurers; non‑life insurance – general insurers; regulator – **IRDAI**.  
- **Bancassurance:** banks sell insurance products on behalf of insurers.

## 7. NBFCs and Systemic Risk – Concept Snapshot

- Failure of a large NBFC (e.g. IL&FS‑type cases) can create **systemic risk**:
  - contagion in financial markets,  
  - stress on banks lending to NBFCs,  
  - loss of confidence.

Therefore:

- RBI has tightened NBFC regulation and supervision:
  - scale‑based regulation,  
  - liquidity norms,  
  - enhanced governance and risk management standards.

- NBFCs and banks are **highly interconnected**:
  - banks lend to NBFCs,  
  - co‑lending relationships,  
  - securitisation transactions,  
  - investment in NBFC instruments.

Hence, the **health of NBFCs** is crucial for overall financial stability.

## 8. Exam One‑Liners – NBFC & FIs

1. NBFC = **Non‑Banking Financial Company** – does financial activities but is not a bank.  
2. NBFCs are incorporated under the **Companies Act** and regulated by **RBI** (activity/size‑based).  
3. Banks can accept demand deposits and offer cheques directly; NBFCs generally cannot.  
4. Important NBFC types – **NBFC‑ICC, NBFC‑MFI, NBFC‑Factor, IFC, IDF‑NBFC, CIC**, etc.  
5. Development FIs – **NABARD, SIDBI, EXIM Bank, NHB** – apex institutions for specific sectors.  
6. NBFCs play a key role in financial inclusion and niche segments (vehicle finance, microcredit, infra finance, etc.).  
7. Large NBFC failures can create systemic risk – hence RBI’s strong regulatory focus on NBFCs.

## 9. Memory Tricks – NBFC

**Trick 1 – “NBFC = Not a Bank, but a Finance Company”**

- The name itself distinguishes it from a bank –  
  it finances, but without full banking powers.

**Trick 2 – “B–C–D–M” – Roles of NBFCs**

- **B – Borrow** – raise funds from markets / banks.  
- **C – Credit** – lend to various segments.  
- **D – Develop** – help develop specific sectors (vehicle, infra, micro, etc.).  
- **M – Market Link** – provide links via securitisation, co‑lending, capital market instruments.

Combine this static note with NBFC‑related current affairs –  
liquidity issues, new RBI guidelines, scale‑based regulation –  
to cover both **Static + Dynamic** aspects of NBFCs in exams.
