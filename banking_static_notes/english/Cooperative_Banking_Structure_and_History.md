# Cooperative Banking in India – Structure and History (English)

This file covers the **history, structure, features and exam points** related to cooperative banking in India.

---

## 1. Cooperative Banking – Basic Idea

Cooperative banks are based on the principle of **“cooperation”**:

- **“One member, one vote”** – voting power does not depend on number of shares.  
- Objective: **service and mutual help**, not pure profit maximisation.  
- Members are usually from the same community / area / occupation and can be both:
  - depositors, and  
  - borrowers.

Cooperative banks primarily serve:

- Rural areas – agriculture and allied activities,  
- Urban and semi‑urban areas – small traders, salaried class, small businesses.

## 2. Short History – Cooperative Movement in India

### 2.1 Early Cooperative Credit Laws

- By the end of the 19th century, rural indebtedness was very high –  
  farmers were heavily dependent on moneylenders.  
- To address this, the Government introduced the **cooperative model**.

Key milestones (concept level):

1. **Early Cooperative Credit Societies Act (early 1900s):**  
   - Provided legal base for primary credit societies at village level.

2. **Subsequent Cooperative Societies Act (1910s):**  
   - Broadened the scope to include non‑credit and multi‑purpose societies.

(For exams, you can memorise exact Acts and years like 1904 and 1912 in a separate law‑history note.)

### 2.2 Post‑Independence Developments

- Five‑Year Plans emphasised strengthening cooperative credit for agriculture and rural development.  
- Committees like the **All India Rural Credit Survey** recommended a **three‑tier cooperative structure**:
  - state, district and village level institutions.

> Exam idea: The cooperative movement aimed to provide **cheap institutional credit to rural poor** and reduce moneylender dependence.

## 3. Rural Cooperative Banking Structure – Three‑Tier Model

The short‑term rural cooperative credit structure is usually explained as three tiers:

### 3.1 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)

- **Grass‑root level** unit – at village or group‑of‑villages level.  
- Members = local farmers and rural households.  
- Main functions:
  - Short‑term crop loans,  
  - consumption credit,  
  - supply of fertilisers, seeds and other inputs.

> Note: PACS are technically credit cooperatives, not “banks” in the full sense,  
> but form the **base of the rural cooperative credit structure**.

### 3.2 District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs)

- District‑level cooperative banks.  
- Member institutions = PACS (and sometimes individuals).  
- Role:
  - Provide credit / refinance to PACS,  
  - Accept deposits and lend at district level.

### 3.3 State Cooperative Banks (StCBs / SCBs)

- State‑level apex cooperative banks.  
- Members = DCCBs and other cooperatives.  
- Role:
  - Apex for the state’s cooperative credit structure,  
  - Obtain refinance from NABARD etc. and channel it to DCCBs.

These three levels together form the **short‑term rural cooperative credit structure**.

## 4. Long‑Term Cooperative Credit – Land Development / Agriculture & Rural Development Banks

Alongside short‑term credit, a **long‑term cooperative credit structure** also developed:

- **State Cooperative Agriculture & Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs)**  
  (earlier called Land Development Banks – LDBs).  
- Role:
  - Provide long‑term loans for land development, irrigation, farm investments, etc.

Exam questions usually focus on conceptual differences between:

- short‑term cooperative credit structure, and  
- long‑term cooperative structures.

---

## 5. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)

- Operate mainly in **urban and semi‑urban areas**.  
- Clientele:
  - small savers, salaried class, small traders, small industries, self‑employed persons.  

- Features:
  - Follow cooperative principles (one member, one vote),  
  - Area of operation in cities/towns.

- Services:
  - Savings and current accounts,  
  - small personal and business loans,  
  - micro and small business credit.

Important exam angles for UCBs:

- Classification by area and size,  
- Regulatory framework (RBI + Registrar of Cooperative Societies / Central Registrar),  
- Recent reforms and issues.

---

## 6. Dual Control / Regulation – RBI + Registrar

Cooperative banks generally come under **dual control**:

- **RBI / NABARD side (for banking functions):**
  - Provisions of the Banking Regulation Act,  
  - Licensing, prudential norms, CRR/SLR, inspection, etc.

- **Registrar of Cooperative Societies (State / Central):**
  - Registration, management, elections, audit under cooperative laws.

Because of this dual control:

- Governance issues and coordination problems have often arisen,  
- Delays in corrective action,  
- Hence, repeated proposals and amendments to strengthen regulation.

(For exams, refer to latest amendments to know which cooperative banks are fully under RBI and which under dual framework.)

## 7. Strengths and Weaknesses of Cooperative Banking

### 7.1 Strengths

- **Local Knowledge:**  
  - Members know local borrowers personally, improving credit appraisal at the grass‑root level.

- **Financial Inclusion:**  
  - Provide banking services in remote rural areas and small urban centres.

- **Member Ownership:**  
  - Depositors and borrowers are often the same members; stronger relationship.

### 7.2 Weaknesses / Challenges

- **Governance & Political Interference:**  
  - Local politics, board interference, lack of professional management.  

- **Capital Constraints:**  
  - Limited share capital; difficult to raise fresh capital.  

- **NPA & Risk Management Issues:**  
  - Weak credit appraisal, monitoring and recovery practices in many cases.  

- **Dual Control:**  
  - Coordination issues between RBI and Registrars.

Hence recent reforms focus on:

- Stronger regulatory framework,  
- Restructuring / consolidation of UCBs,  
- Computerisation & modernisation of PACS.

## 8. Exam One‑Liners – Cooperative Banking

1. Cooperative banks operate on **“one member, one vote”** principle.  
2. Primary objective – **service and mutual help**, not pure profit.  
3. Rural cooperative credit structure is **three‑tier**:
   - PACS (village level),  
   - DCCBs (district level),  
   - State Cooperative Banks (state level).  
4. Long‑term cooperative credit is provided by **Land Development / Agriculture & Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs)**.  
5. Urban Cooperative Banks serve small depositors, traders and salaried classes in urban / semi‑urban areas.  
6. Cooperative banks are subject to **dual control** – RBI/NABARD and Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  
7. The cooperative movement’s aim was to provide **cheap institutional credit to rural poor** and reduce reliance on moneylenders.

## 9. Memory Tricks – Cooperative Banking

**Trick 1 – “P–D–S = 3‑Floor Cooperative Building”**

Visualise a building:

- Ground floor – **P** = PACS (Primary societies)  
- Middle floor – **D** = DCCB (District Central Cooperative Bank)  
- Top floor – **S** = State Cooperative Bank  

**Trick 2 – “1 Member, 1 Vote – Cooperative Note”**

- Cooperative = **“one member, one vote”** regardless of shares held.  
To remember:

> **“One member, one vote – that’s the cooperative note.”**

You can supplement this file with:

- State‑wise cooperative structures,  
- Key committees on cooperatives,  
- Latest UCB reforms / RBI circulars,  

to cover both static and current aspects for exams.
