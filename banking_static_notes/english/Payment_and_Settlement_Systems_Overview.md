# Payment and Settlement Systems – Overview (English)

This file gives a basic static overview of **India’s payment and settlement systems** –  
NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, cheque clearing, PSS Act, and the roles of RBI and NPCI.

## 1. Payment System & Settlement System – Basic Concepts

- **Payment System:**  
  - Any system through which **money is transferred** from one entity to another (funds transfer).

- **Settlement System:**  
  - The process by which transactions are **finally settled** (debits and credits posted in participants’ accounts).

In India, the main legal framework is:

- **Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSS Act)**  
- **Regulator:** Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

## 2. PSS Act, 2007 – Short Summary

Under the PSS Act, RBI can:

- Authorise, regulate and supervise payment systems,  
- Authorise system providers (banks, card networks, NPCI, etc.),  
- Issue standards and guidelines, and exercise oversight.

After PSS Act:

- NEFT, RTGS, card networks, clearing houses, wallets, etc. operate under a clear legal framework.

## 3. Major Fund Transfer Systems – Overview

### 3.1 NEFT – National Electronic Funds Transfer

- **Type:** Deferred net settlement‑based retail funds transfer system.  
- **Use:** Account‑to‑account transfer for individuals, firms, corporates.  
- **Key Features (concept):**
  - Both sending and receiving branches must be NEFT‑enabled.  
  - Typically used for small and medium‑value transfers.  
  - Settlement done in multiple daily batches (recently near‑real‑time multiple settlements).

### 3.2 RTGS – Real Time Gross Settlement

- **Type:** Real‑time, gross settlement system.  
- **Use:** Large‑value, urgent funds transfers by banks, corporates and individuals.  
- **Key Features:**
  - **Real‑time** – processed immediately on receipt.  
  - **Gross settlement** – each transaction settled individually (no netting).  
  - Minimum transaction amount threshold applies (check latest figure for the exam year).

### 3.3 IMPS – Immediate Payment Service

- **Operator:** NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India).  
- **Type:** 24×7 instant interbank electronic funds transfer.  
- **Use:** Accessible via mobile banking, internet banking, ATMs, and as the backend for some UPI transactions.  
- **Key Feature:** **Immediate** credit – real‑time 24×7.

## 4. Cheque Clearing, ECS, NACH – Brief Overview

### 4.1 Cheque Clearing System

- Cheque is a **paper‑based negotiable instrument**.  
- Earlier, physical cheques were exchanged in clearing houses;  
  now, **CTS (Cheque Truncation System)** uses scanned images, making clearing faster and safer.

### 4.2 ECS – Electronic Clearing Service

- Used for bulk, recurring payments/receipts (salaries, pensions, dividends, utility bills).  
- Largely replaced/complemented by **NACH**.

### 4.3 NACH – National Automated Clearing House

- Developed and operated by **NPCI**.  
- Used for bulk transactions such as:
  - subsidies, pensions, salaries, utility bills, insurance premiums, etc.  
- Widely used for Government DBT and subsidy payments.

## 5. Roles of RBI and NPCI in Payment Systems

### 5.1 RBI – Payment System Regulator

- Under the PSS Act, RBI:
  - authorises payment systems,  
  - issues rules and regulations,  
  - supervises and oversees payment and settlement systems.  

- RBI directly operates:
  - **RTGS**,  
  - **NEFT**.  

- RBI’s objective is to ensure the **safety, efficiency and stability** of payment systems.

### 5.2 NPCI – National Payments Corporation of India

- NPCI is an **umbrella organisation** for retail payment systems (a system operator, not a regulator).  
- Major products:
  - **IMPS** – Immediate Payment Service,  
  - **UPI** – Unified Payments Interface,  
  - **RuPay** – domestic card network,  
  - **BHIM** app,  
  - **BBPS**, **AEPS**, **NACH**, etc.

RBI regulates; NPCI operates these systems within the regulatory framework.

## 6. Settlement Systems – RTGS and Clearing Houses

- **RTGS:**  
  - Used for large‑value, real‑time settlement among banks.  
  - Banks maintain RTGS accounts with RBI; inter‑bank settlements occur there.

- **Clearing Houses:**  
  - Handle net settlement for cheque and some retail payment instruments.  
  - Final settlement usually takes place in RBI accounts via RTGS.

> Exam angle: **“RTGS – real‑time, gross; NEFT – deferred, net; IMPS – 24×7 instant retail.”**

## 7. Security, Risk & Oversight – High Level

- Payment systems face **settlement risk, operational risk and fraud risk**.  
- RBI and system operators mitigate these through:
  - multi‑layer security,  
  - robust IT infrastructure,  
  - business continuity plans,  
  - monitoring and surveillance mechanisms.

- For users:
  - transaction limits,  
  - Two‑factor authentication (OTP, PIN, etc.),  
  - transaction alerts,  
  - dispute resolution frameworks.

## 9. Memory Tricks – Payment Systems

**Trick 1 – “R–N–I: RTGS–NEFT–IMPS”**

- **R – RTGS** = **Real‑time**, **Rich (high value)**  
- **N – NEFT** = **Net settlement** for retail  
- **I – IMPS** = **Instant** 24×7 retail transfer  

**Trick 2 – “RBI Regulator, NPCI Operator”**

- RBI – sets laws and regulations (PSS Act), oversees systems.  
- NPCI – operates UPI, IMPS, RuPay, NACH, AEPS, BBPS, etc.
