## 2. Background & Establishment Timeline

- Before NABARD, agricultural and rural credit functions were handled mainly by:
  - RBI’s Agricultural Credit Department, and  
  - Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC).  

- In the 1970s, a need was felt for a separate apex institution for rural credit.  

- The **B. Sivaraman Committee** (Committee to Review Arrangements for Institutional Credit for Agriculture and Rural Development – CRAICARD) recommended an integrated apex body for agriculture and rural development credit.

- Based on these recommendations:
  - **NABARD Act, 1981** was passed,  
  - NABARD was formally established on **12 July 1982**.  

- ARDC and RBI’s agricultural credit functions were transferred to NABARD.
