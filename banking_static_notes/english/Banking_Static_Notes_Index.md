- “Case Studies / Flow Charts” – e.g., NPA resolution flow, UPI transaction flow, cheque clearing process, etc.

1. When you need a topic, first find its section here.  
2. Open the corresponding `.md` file and study in detail.  
3. Whenever you see a banking news item in daily current affairs, link it back to the relevant static note here –  
   that way, your **concepts + current affairs** stay connected.
