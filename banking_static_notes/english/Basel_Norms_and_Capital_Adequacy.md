# Basel Norms and Capital Adequacy – Static Notes (English)

This file explains the concept of **capital adequacy** for banks and the **Basel Norms (Basel I, II, III)** in an exam‑oriented way.

---

## 1. Capital Adequacy – Basic Idea

When a bank lends, it takes risk. If there are heavy losses, depositors’ money is at risk.  
Therefore, a bank must have sufficient **“owners’ funds” (capital)** to absorb losses.

- **Capital Adequacy** means:  
  the bank has **enough capital relative to its risk‑weighted assets** to be considered safe.

The main ratio used is:

> **Capital to Risk‑Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) / Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**  

Conceptual formula:

- **CAR = (Regulatory Capital / Risk‑Weighted Assets) × 100**

Higher CAR ⇒ stronger loss‑absorbing capacity.

## 2. Regulatory Capital – Tier I & Tier II

### 2.1 Tier I Capital (Core Capital)

- **Highest quality capital** – absorbs losses while the bank remains a going concern.  
- Conceptual examples:
  - Paid‑up equity capital  
  - Disclosed reserves  
  - Retained earnings  
  - Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) under Basel III

### 2.2 Tier II Capital (Supplementary Capital)

- Medium‑quality capital – more relevant in winding‑up scenarios.  
- Conceptual examples:
  - Subordinated debt  
  - General provisions  
  - Certain hybrid instruments (subject to conditions)

Regulators prescribe minimum **overall CAR** and also minimum **Tier I / CET1 percentages**  
(exact percentages must be checked from latest RBI guidelines for the exam year).

## 3. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)

- After the 1974 Herstatt Bank failure, a need for global coordination in banking supervision was felt.  
- **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS):**
  - Located at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), **Basel, Switzerland**.  
  - Group of central banks/supervisors from major countries.  
  - Objective:  
    - Set **global standards and guidelines** for banking supervision,  
    - Promote financial stability and reduce cross‑border risks.

BCBS issued the **Basel I, Basel II, Basel III** capital frameworks.

## 4. Basel I – First Capital Accord

- **Year:** 1988 (implemented in many countries during late 80s / early 90s)  
- **Focus:**
  - Set minimum capital standards for **credit risk**.

**Key Features (Concept):**

- Introduced the concept of **Risk‑Weighted Assets (RWA)**.  
- Assigned risk weights (0%, 20%, 50%, 100%, etc.) to different asset classes.  
- Prescribed a **global minimum CAR (historically 8% of RWA)**.

Basel I was a relatively simple framework with limited risk differentiation; later enhanced by Basel II.

## 5. Basel II – Three‑Pillar Framework

Basel II aimed to:

- Make capital requirements more **risk‑sensitive**,  
- Strengthen supervision and market discipline.

### 5.1 Three Pillars of Basel II

1. **Pillar 1 – Minimum Capital Requirements**  
   - Capital for credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.  
   - Various approaches for measuring risk (Standardised, Internal Ratings‑Based – IRB).

2. **Pillar 2 – Supervisory Review Process**  
   - Regulators (e.g. RBI) review banks’ internal capital adequacy assessments and risk management systems.  
   - Can require **additional capital** for higher‑risk banks.

3. **Pillar 3 – Market Discipline**  
   - Requires disclosures on capital, risk exposures, risk management practices.  
   - Enables market participants to make informed decisions, enhancing discipline.

## 6. Basel III – Post‑Crisis Strengthening

The 2007–08 global financial crisis revealed:

- Insufficient **high‑quality capital**,  
- Excessive leverage,  
- Serious liquidity mismatches.

To address these issues, BCBS introduced **Basel III** (from around 2010 onwards).

### 6.1 Major Features of Basel III (Concept Level)

1. **Higher and Better‑Quality Capital**

   - Emphasis on **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)** –  
     the highest quality capital (pure equity + retained earnings).  
   - Higher minimum ratios for CET1, Tier I and Total Capital.

2. **Capital Buffers**

   - **Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB):**  
     - Additional capital buffer to be built up in normal times,  
     - can be drawn down in stress periods.

   - **Counter‑cyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB):**  
     - Extra capital during credit booms,  
     - to be used during downturns.

3. **Leverage Ratio**

   - A **non‑risk‑based** measure.  
   - Minimum Tier I capital as a ratio of total exposure (on‑balance + off‑balance).  
   - Limits excessive leverage.

4. **Liquidity Standards**

   - **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):**  
     - Banks must hold enough High‑Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)  
       to cover net cash outflows over a 30‑day stress period.

   - **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):**  
     - Ensures long‑term stable funding for long‑term assets.  
     - Ratio of Available Stable Funding to Required Stable Funding.

5. **Systemically Important Banks (SIBs) Buffers**

   - Additional capital requirements for globally or domestically systemically important banks (G‑SIBs, D‑SIBs).

(Exact percentage thresholds and timelines differ by country; in India, RBI has implemented Basel III in a phased manner – always check current norms.)

## 7. Basel Norms in India – Adoption (High Level)

- **Basel I:** adopted by India in the 1990s.  
- **Basel II:** implemented in phases during the 2000s for Indian commercial banks.  
- **Basel III:** implemented gradually from the 2010s onwards –  
  including CET1, CCB, leverage ratio, LCR, NSFR, etc.

RBI generally prescribes **capital requirements slightly higher** than the global minimum,  
to enhance the safety of the Indian banking system.

## 8. Why Capital Adequacy and Basel Norms Matter (Exam Angle)

- **Depositor Confidence:**  
  - Strong capital position reduces the risk of bank failure.  

- **Financial Stability:**  
  - Lower systemic risk and reduced possibility of contagion.  

- **International Integration:**  
  - Necessary for cross‑border operations and investor confidence.  

- **Risk Management Culture:**  
  - Encourages proper risk measurement and sound internal risk management practices.

## 9. Exam‑Friendly One‑Liners – Basel & Capital

1. **CAR / CRAR = Regulatory Capital / Risk‑Weighted Assets × 100.**  
2. **Tier I capital** = core capital (equity, reserves); **Tier II** = supplementary capital.  
3. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – located at **BIS, Basel (Switzerland)** – issues global banking supervision standards.  
4. **Basel I (1988)** – mainly focused on **credit risk**, with simple risk weights and minimum capital.  
5. **Basel II** – based on **3 Pillars**:  
   - Pillar 1 – Minimum capital requirements,  
   - Pillar 2 – Supervisory review,  
   - Pillar 3 – Market discipline.  
6. **Basel III** – post‑crisis framework:  
   - Higher CET1, capital buffers, leverage ratio, LCR, NSFR, etc.  
7. In India, Basel norms are implemented by **RBI** in a phased manner; India generally keeps capital requirements **slightly higher than global minimums**.

## 10. Memory Tricks – Basel Norms

**Trick 1 – “1 Risk, 2 Pillars, 3 Buffers”**

- **Basel I** – one main focus: **credit risk** capital.  
- **Basel II** – **three pillars**: capital, supervision, disclosure.  
- **Basel III** – multiple **buffers**: CET1 focus, conservation buffer, counter‑cyclical buffer, liquidity buffers.

**Trick 2 – “CAR = Capital Above Risk”**

To remember CAR:

- Think of **Capital Above Risk** –  
  CAR = Capital / Risk‑Weighted Assets –  
  the more capital above risk, the safer the bank.

For exam preparation, you should separately note:

- India’s exact minimum CET1, Tier I, Total Capital %,  
- CCB %, leverage ratio %, LCR / NSFR implementation timelines,  

from the latest RBI Master Circulars / Directions.
