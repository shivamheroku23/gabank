# Priority Sector Lending (PSL) – Static Notes (English)

Priority Sector Lending (PSL) is a **core policy tool** in India’s banking system.  
It ensures that bank credit does not remain confined only to large corporates, but also reaches  
**agriculture, MSMEs, weaker sections, housing and other critical sectors.**

---

## 1. PSL – Definition (Exam Style)

- RBI has identified certain sectors as **“priority sectors”**.  
- Scheduled Commercial Banks (and SFBs, etc.) are required to lend **a minimum specified % of their  
  Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) / Credit Equivalent of Off‑Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE)** to these sectors.  
- This minimum percentage is called the **PSL target**.

> Simple line:  
> **“PSL = RBI’s rule requiring banks to lend a minimum % of credit to specified important sectors like agriculture and MSMEs.”**

(Exact percentage targets differ by bank category and time – always refer to the latest RBI circulars for the exam year.)

## 2. Objectives of PSL

1. **Inclusive Growth & Development:**  
   - Support key sectors like agriculture, MSMEs, weaker sections, low‑cost housing, etc.  

2. **Balanced Regional Development:**  
   - Increase credit flow to backward and under‑banked regions.  

3. **Financial Inclusion:**  
   - Bring small borrowers and poor households into the formal credit system.  

4. **Employment Generation:**  
   - Generate jobs through credit to MSMEs, small businesses and services.  

5. **Social Justice:**  
   - Reduce inequalities by ensuring affordable credit to weaker sections.

## 3. Major PSL Categories (High Level)

Broadly, RBI classifies PSL into the following categories (conceptual):

1. **Agriculture**  
2. **Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)**  
3. **Export Credit**  
4. **Education**  
5. **Housing**  
6. **Social Infrastructure**  
7. **Renewable Energy**  
8. **Others / Weaker Sections**, etc., as per RBI’s detailed guidelines.

Each category has its own sub‑limits, eligibility criteria and size caps, updated from time to time.

## 4. Agriculture – Core Pillar of PSL

Agriculture PSL is usually divided into three broad heads:

### 4.1 Farm Credit (Direct Agriculture)

- Crop loans (short‑term),  
- Kisan Credit Card (KCC),  
- Farm mechanisation (tractors, power tillers, pump sets),  
- Allied activities – dairy, poultry, fisheries, animal husbandry, etc.

### 4.2 Agriculture Infrastructure

- Storage / warehousing, cold storage, pack houses, grading and processing units, etc.  
- Irrigation infrastructure, minor bridges, etc., as specified by RBI.

### 4.3 Ancillary Activities

- Input dealers (seed, fertiliser, pesticide dealers),  
- Custom hiring centres,  
- Marketing, processing units, value chain services.

Common exam questions:

- Does farm credit come under PSL Agriculture? (Yes – subject to conditions.)  
- Does agriculture infrastructure count under PSL? (Yes – up to specified limits.)

---

## 5. MSME – Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises

- **MSME** sector is a major part of PSL:  
  - manufacturing and services units classified as micro/small/medium enterprises.  
  - Definitions are based on investment/turnover – check latest official MSME definitions.

Concept points:

- There is often a **sub‑target for micro enterprises** within the overall PSL target.  
- Both working capital (CC/OD) and term loans can qualify for PSL, subject to RBI rules.

---

## 6. Other Key PSL Categories – Short Overview

### 6.1 Export Credit

- Credit to eligible exporters (within specified limits / categories) can be classified under PSL.

### 6.2 Education

- Education loans to students (studies in India and abroad) up to a prescribed ceiling amount  
  fall under PSL.

### 6.3 Housing

- Housing loans to individuals for home purchase / construction up to a specified limit  
  can be classified under PSL.  
- PSL gives special support to **affordable housing**.

### 6.4 Social Infrastructure

- Loans for schools, health centres, drinking water facilities, sanitation, etc.,  
  up to specified project limits.

### 6.5 Renewable Energy

- Loans for solar, wind, small hydro, biomass, etc. up to project / individual limits  
  are eligible under PSL.

---

## 7. Weaker Sections – Special Focus

“Weaker sections” is an important sub‑category under PSL, typically including (as per RBI definition):

- Small and marginal farmers,  
- Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST),  
- Self Help Groups (SHGs),  
- Some notified minority communities,  
- Persons with disabilities, etc.

Banks have a **separate sub‑target** for lending to weaker sections under PSL  
(exact % must be checked from latest RBI directions).

---

## 8. PSL Targets – Conceptual (Without Fixing Numbers)

PSL target structure differs across bank categories:

- **Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks (public and private):**  
  - Overall PSL target = minimum % of ANBC / CEOBE.  
  - Sub‑targets for agriculture, small & marginal farmers, micro enterprises, weaker sections.

- **Foreign Banks:**  
  - PSL frameworks differ based on branch network (≥ 20 branches vs. < 20 branches).

- **Small Finance Banks (SFBs):**  
  - Generally higher PSL targets because they focus on underserved segments.

Since % values are revised periodically,  
**always refer to the latest RBI Master Directions / circulars** for exam‑specific numbers.

## 9. PSL – Reporting, Shortfall & PSLCs

### 9.1 Reporting & Monitoring

- Banks report PSL data to RBI on a periodic (quarterly/annual) basis.  
- RBI monitors whether banks meet their overall and sub‑targets.

### 9.2 Shortfall

- If a bank fails to meet its PSL targets:
  - It may be required to contribute to specific funds (e.g. RIDF – Rural Infrastructure Development Fund),  
    as per RBI guidelines.

### 9.3 Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs)

- **PSLC** is a **market‑based instrument** that allows transfer of PSL “achievement” between banks:

  - Seller bank: has surpassed PSL targets and can sell the surplus.  
  - Buyer bank: has shortfall and can buy PSLCs to meet regulatory PSL requirements.

- This enables flexibility in meeting PSL targets and improves allocation of credit based on capacity and demand.

## 10. Exam One‑Liners – PSL

1. PSL = **mandatory minimum % lending** by banks to specified priority sectors (e.g. agriculture, MSMEs).  
2. Main objective – **inclusive growth, balanced development and support to weaker sections**.  
3. Agriculture PSL comprises **Farm Credit + Agriculture Infrastructure + Ancillary Activities**.  
4. MSME PSL covers working capital and term loans to micro, small and medium enterprises.  
5. Weaker Sections under PSL have a **separate sub‑target** (SC/ST, small & marginal farmers, SHGs, etc.).  
6. Different bank categories (domestic, foreign, SFBs) have **different PSL targets**.  
7. Banks with PSL shortfall may have to contribute to specified funds as per RBI guidelines.  
8. PSLCs (Priority Sector Lending Certificates) allow banks to trade PSL achievement and manage targets.

## 11. Memory Tricks – PSL

**Trick 1 – “A–M–E–H–S–R” – Main PSL Sectors**

- **A – Agriculture**  
- **M – MSME**  
- **E – Export**  
- **H – Housing**  
- **S – Social Infrastructure**  
- **R – Renewable Energy**  

(Plus “others / weaker sections” as per RBI list.)

**Trick 2 – “PSL = Public Service Lending”**

Think of **Priority Sector Lending ≈ Public Service Lending** –  
reminds you that these loans support **public and social objectives**, not just profit.

For exam preparation, combine this file with:

- latest PSL targets and sub‑targets,  
- recent RBI circulars on PSL,  
- and PSL‑related news (e.g. new categories, PSLC trends),  

to have **Static + Current** coverage of PSL.
