## 7. NBFCs and Systemic Risk – Concept Snapshot

- Large NBFCs failure (for example, past IL&FS type case) financial system me contagion create kar sakta hai.  
- Isliye:

  - RBI ne NBFC supervision tighten ki,  
  - scale based regulation,  
  - liquidity norms,  
  - stress testing etc. introduce kiya.

- NBFCs + banks interconnected hote hain (bank lending to NBFCs, co‑lending, securitisation etc.),  
  - isliye NBFC health = banking system stability ka bhi part.
