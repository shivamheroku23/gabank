## TOPIC 4: Safeguard/Protection Measures on Steel Imports

### What happened?

- The government has approved **safeguard/protection measures** (such as safeguard duty/higher tariffs)  
  on certain **steel products** to protect domestic producers from:  
  - import surges, and  
  - dumping by foreign players.  
- The measures may run up to **2028** (extensions/updated rates).  
- Objective:  
  - support Indian steel plants,  
  - preserve jobs and the domestic capex cycle.

### Why important for bank exams?

- Steel has a long history of **big loans and NPAs** in the banking system;  
  any policy affecting this sector changes banks’ risk profiles.  
- Well‑designed protection:  
  - can improve domestic producers’ cash flows,  
  - and help stabilise **asset quality**;  
  but excessive tariffs risk **cost‑push inflation**.

### Memory Trick – “Steel Shield”

> Safeguard duty on steel = a **shield**  
> to protect domestic plants, and indirectly  
> to avoid a repeat of old steel‑sector NPAs for banks.

## TOPIC 5: External/Payments Indicators – Forex, Trade & Digital

### What stood out?

  - boosting banks’ **fee income** and **float (CASA balances)**.

### Bank‑exam link

- Forex reserves, Current Account Deficit (CAD) and digital payments growth  
  are core economy‑plus‑banking concepts.  
- Typical MCQs:  
  - Who manages India’s forex reserves? → **RBI**.  
  - Why are high reserves important? → for **external stability**,  
    defending the rupee, and supporting sovereign ratings.

### Memory Trick – “3D: Deficit, Defence, Digital”

> For the external sector, remember **3D** –  
> **Deficit (CAD), Defence (forex reserves defend the rupee), Digital (UPI/IMPS flows)**.
