## TOPIC 1: India – 4th Largest Economy (Ahead of Japan)

- On the basis of nominal GDP (2025‑26 estimates),  
  **India has overtaken Japan** to become the **4th‑largest economy** in the world.  
- Approximate nominal GDP: **USD 4.1–4.2 trillion** (based on World Bank/IMF projections).  
- Order (around 2026):  
  1. United States  
  2. China  
  3. Germany  
  4. India  
  5. Japan  

### SSC exam points

- India’s approximate rank by nominal GDP (2026 context) → **4th**.  
- Country overtaken → **Japan**.

### Memory Trick – “3G–4I–5J”

> 3rd – **G**ermany, 4th – **I**ndia, 5th – **J**apan.  
> Code: **“3G–4I–5J – Germany, India, Japan.”**

## TOPIC 2: PM GatiShakti – Big Highway/Infra Projects

- Under the **PM GatiShakti National Master Plan**,  
  the Centre has cleared several **multi‑lane highways and corridors**, including:  
  - economic corridors,  
  - port connectivity projects,  
  - greenfield highways linking industrial clusters.  
- Aim:  
  - reduce **logistics cost**,  
  - improve connectivity between ports, industrial hubs and cities,  
  - create jobs in construction and allied sectors.

### SSC exam points

- PM GatiShakti launched in **2021** as the **“National Master Plan for Multi‑modal Connectivity”**.  
- Coordinating ministry: **Ministry of Commerce & Industry**;  
  major implementing ministries: **MoRTH, Railways, Ports, Civil Aviation**, etc.

### Memory Trick – “GATI = Gateway for All‑round Transport Integration”

> PM GatiShakti = **GATI** – Gateway for All‑round Transport Integration –  
> integrating road, rail, port and air networks through one digital master plan.

## TOPIC 3: Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM) Manufacturing Scheme

- The government has approved a scheme for  
  **Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM)** manufacturing.  
- Uses of REPM:  
  - **electric vehicle (EV) motors**,  
  - **wind turbines**,  
  - **defence electronics**, robotics, aerospace, etc.  
- Objective:  
  - reduce dependence on imports (especially from China),  
  - ensure **Atmanirbhar Bharat** in critical magnet materials.

### SSC exam points

- REPM are used in high‑performance **EVs, wind energy, defence and electronics**.  
- The scheme aims at **domestic production of strategic rare‑earth magnets**.

### Memory Trick – “REPM = Rare Earth Power Magnet”

> REPM – think of it as a **Rare Earth Power Magnet** –  
> powering EVs, wind turbines and defence systems.

## TOPIC 4: Dulhasti Stage‑II Hydroelectric Project – Chenab (J&amp;K)

- **Dulhasti Stage‑II Hydroelectric Project (HEP)** in **Jammu &amp; Kashmir**  
  has received **environmental clearance** from MoEFCC’s Expert Appraisal Committee.  
- Location: on the **Chenab River**, downstream of the existing Dulhasti HEP.  
- Capacity: around **260–300 MW** (exact figure may vary slightly in reports; exam need: name + river + state).

### SSC static points

- Dulhasti, Ratle and Baglihar HEPs are all associated with the **Chenab River in J&amp;K**.  
- Chenab is one of the important rivers under the **Indus Waters Treaty** (along with Ravi, Beas, etc.).

### Memory Trick – “Dulhasti on Chenab”

> Just remember: **“Dulhasti = Chenab hydro project in J&amp;K.”**

## TOPIC 5: Dhruv‑NG – New Generation HAL Helicopter

- **Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)** has flagged off the production line of  
  **Dhruv‑NG (Next Generation)** at its Bengaluru facility.  
- Dhruv series:  
  - Indigenous **Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH)** platform,  
  - used by the **Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard**.  
- Dhruv‑NG offers improved avionics, better payload and enhanced high‑altitude performance.

### SSC exam points

- Dhruv/Dhruv‑NG – developed by **HAL**.  
- Category: **indigenous multi‑role light helicopter**.  
- Good example of **Atmanirbhar Bharat in defence manufacturing**.

### Memory Trick – “Dhruv = Desi Helicopter”

> DHruv → **Desi Helicopter** by HAL;  
> Dhruv‑NG → **Next‑Gen Dhruv** – upgraded Indian chopper.
