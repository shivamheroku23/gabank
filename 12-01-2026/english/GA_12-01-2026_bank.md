## TOPIC 1: RBI’s In-Principle Approval for Bank of Baroda’s Standalone Primary Dealer

### What happened?

- In January 2026, the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** granted in-principle approval to **Bank of Baroda (BoB)** to transfer its existing **Bank Primary Dealer (Bank PD)** business into a **wholly-owned subsidiary registered as a Standalone Primary Dealer (SPD)**.  
- At present, BoB undertakes its PD activity within the bank; after restructuring, the new SPD subsidiary will have a **separate licence, capital base and risk framework** dedicated to G-Sec market-making.  
- Primary Dealers are RBI-authorised entities that **underwrite government dated securities** and actively participate in **primary auctions and secondary market trading**.  
- As per RBI data, India currently has **7 SPDs and 14 Bank PDs**; BoB’s move will shift it from the second group towards the first.  
- The in-principle nod is subject to BoB meeting conditions related to **capital adequacy, governance, ring-fencing of the SPD and robust risk management systems**.  
  (Official context: RBI – Press releases on primary dealer authorisations, https://www.rbi.org.in &gt; Press Releases)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- PDs are frequently asked in GA: **role in G-Sec markets, support to government borrowing and impact on yields and SLR portfolios**.  
- Exams may test the difference between a **Bank PD** (PD activity within a bank) and an **SPD** (separate NBFC-like entity focused on G-Secs).  
- For mains/interviews, this is a good example of how large PSBs use **specialised subsidiaries** (SPD, merchant banking, broking, AMCs) to deepen capital-market operations.

### Memory Trick – “BoB moves from Bank PD to SPD”

> Remember: **“BoB = Bank PD se SPD subsidiary ki taraf shift in 2026.”**

## TOPIC 2: Skydo Gets RBI Licence as Payment Aggregator – Cross Border (PA-CB)

### What happened?

- RBI has granted final authorisation to **Skydo** as a **Payment Aggregator – Cross Border (PA-CB)** under its framework for processing export transactions.  
- Skydo offers a platform through which **Indian exporters, freelancers and MSMEs** can receive payments from overseas buyers in multiple currencies, with settlements ultimately credited in INR via authorised dealer (AD) banks.  
- As a PA-CB, Skydo is permitted to **onboard merchants, collect funds in designated collection accounts abroad and route settlements through AD Category-I banks**, subject to FEMA and KYC/AML rules.  
- The authorisation follows an earlier **in-principle approval and sandbox testing**, bringing Skydo formally into RBI’s regulated perimeter for cross-border payments.  
  (Official context: RBI – list of authorised Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways, https://www.rbi.org.in)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Payment aggregators are now a **licenced category under RBI**, and PA-CB is specifically for **cross-border (export/import) online payments**.  
- Banks interact with PA-CB entities as **settlement banks and AD banks**, so GA questions may test **what PA-CB stands for and what it can do**.  
- PA-CB players help channel export receivables through **formal FX routes**, supporting **FX inflows, compliance and service exports**.

### Memory Trick – “Skydo = PA-CB for exporters”

> Hook: **“Skydo → sky-level global collections for Indian exporters (PA-CB licence).”**

---

## TOPIC 3: PayG Authorised as Both PA-P and PA-CB

### What happened?

- RBI has authorised **PayG** as both a **Payment Aggregator – Physical/Proximity (PA-P)** for domestic transactions and a **Payment Aggregator – Cross Border (PA-CB)**.  
- As a **PA-P**, PayG can onboard merchants to accept **card, UPI and QR-based payments at physical points of sale**; as a **PA-CB**, it can process **export-linked online payments** like other cross-border aggregators.  
- The dual authorisation allows PayG to provide an **omni-channel acquiring stack** – in-store, online and cross-border – to MSMEs and large corporate merchants on a single integrated platform.  
- The approvals are subject to conditions like **minimum net-worth, escrow/nodal account safeguards for customer funds, KYC/AML compliance and technology risk controls**.  
  (Official context: RBI – authorisation of payment aggregators, https://www.rbi.org.in)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Shows how RBI is **licensing and supervising fintechs** rather than leaving them entirely unregulated – a likely question in banking awareness.  
- Banks partner or compete with such players in **merchant acquiring, POS, QR networks and cross-border gateways**, so understanding **PA-P vs PA-CB** is essential.  
- It fits in broader themes of **digital payments, financial inclusion and export facilitation** regularly asked in exams.

### Memory Trick – “PayG = two P licences”

> One line: **“PayG gets P + P → PA-P (domestic proximity) and PA-CB (foreign payments).”**

## TOPIC 4: IPPB–Choice Wealth Tie-Up for a Digital Investment Platform

### What happened?

- **India Post Payments Bank (IPPB)** has selected **Choice Wealth Private Limited**, a SEBI-registered investment platform and subsidiary of **Choice International Ltd**, to build a **pan-India digital investment platform**.  
- The platform will be integrated with IPPB’s **mobile app, post offices and Gramin Dak Sevak network**, enabling customers even in remote villages to invest in **mutual funds, sovereign gold bonds (SGBs), select government schemes and other small-ticket products**.  
- Choice Wealth will provide the **technology, execution and back-end operations**, while IPPB will act as the **front-end distributor**, earning fee income instead of interest (payments banks cannot lend).  
- Onboarding will be fully digital, with **e-KYC, risk-profiling and goal-based planning tools** to simplify investing for first-time and small savers.  
  (Official context: IPPB announcements on digital investment platform partnership – https://ippbonline.com)

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- IPPB is a key institution in questions on **financial inclusion, Jan Dhan and doorstep banking**.  
- The tie-up shows how payments banks can build **non-interest income** through distribution of third-party products like investments, insurance and pension schemes.  
- For descriptive answers, this is a strong example of using **postal infrastructure for wealth products and digital inclusion**.

### Memory Trick – “Post office se portfolio”

> Think: **“IPPB + Choice Wealth = mutual funds and SGBs through the post office network.”**

## TOPIC 5: Morgan Stanley Pegs India’s FY26 GDP Growth at 7.6%

### What happened?

- In a January 2026 research note, **Morgan Stanley** projected India’s real GDP growth at **7.6% in FY26**, higher than the **National Statistical Office (NSO)** first advance estimate of around **7.4%**.  
- The brokerage cited **strong domestic demand, sustained government capital expenditure, healthy services exports and easing inflation** as key drivers supporting growth.  
- It expects India to remain the **fastest-growing major economy**, even as global growth slows due to tight financial conditions and geopolitical risks.  
- Risk factors flagged include a potential **El Niño weather pattern from mid-2026, weaker external demand and delays in private-capex revival**, but the medium-term potential is still placed above 7%.  

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- GDP projections by agencies such as **NSO, RBI, World Bank, IMF, rating agencies and big brokerages** are common one-liner questions.  
- For mains/interviews, the 7.6% forecast supports the narrative that **India is a “growth outlier”** and provides context for discussions on **credit growth, asset quality and banking sector profitability**.  
- It also links to topics such as **fiscal consolidation versus growth**, and how macro conditions influence **interest rates and investment**.

### Memory Trick – “7.6% – Morgan’s mark for FY26”

> Remember: **“NSO ~7.4%, Morgan Stanley thoda zyada – 7.6% GDP for FY26.”**
