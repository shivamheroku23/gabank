## Detailed Topics – Bank Weekly (01–07 January 2026)

### TOPIC 1: RBI Digital Banking CAAL Framework (All Channels)

### What happened?

- RBI introduced a unified **digital banking framework** effective **1 January 2026**,  
  often referred to by the mnemonic **CAAL** –  
  **C = Consent, A = Alerts, A = Access control, L = Liability**.  
- The framework applies across **internet banking, mobile banking, UPI, USSD, card‑not‑present transactions, SMS banking** etc.  
- Banks must:  
  - maintain explicit **customer consent logs**,  
  - send **real‑time alerts** for key events,  
  - provide customers **granular access controls** (device/channel/limits),  
  - follow clear **liability‑sharing and grievance timelines** in fraud/dispute cases.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Directly linked to **digital fraud protection, customer rights and operational risk** – frequent MCQ and mains topic.  
- Prelims can ask about **CAAL full form, effective date, covered channels**.  
- Mains/descriptive can ask how CAAL strengthens **customer protection and trust** in digital payments.  

### Memory Trick – “CAAL = All Consent, Alerts, Access &amp; Liability in one call”

> Imagine you don’t need to call the branch – your **Consent, Alerts, Access and Liability**  
> are all managed inside the app: **C–A–A–L**.

---

### TOPIC 2: BSBD “4F” Accounts, PAN–Aadhaar Linking &amp; Weekly Credit Scores

### What happened?

- Banks have been nudged to offer **Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD)** accounts under a **“4F” model**:  
  Free basic services, Full digital access, Flexible deposits, Free from minimum balance.  
- If **PAN is not linked with Aadhaar**, the PAN can be treated as **inoperative** –  
  affecting ITR filing, new account opening, high‑value transactions, loans etc.  
- Credit bureaus must now update borrower data at least **weekly**, making credit scores more dynamic.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- BSBD &amp; “no‑frills” accounts = core of **financial inclusion** and **PMJDY**; important for GA + interview.  
- PAN–Aadhaar linking = **KYC &amp; AML** compliance; affects account operations and loan processing.  
- Weekly score updates impact **risk‑based pricing, early warning signals, retail loan quality**.  

### Memory Trick – “4F = Free, Full, Flexible, Free-from-minimum”

> Think of a BSBD account that is **Free services**, **Full digital**, **Flexible deposits**, and **Free from minimum balance** –  
> 4 times F = **4F**.

---

### TOPIC 3: India – 4th-Largest Economy &amp; World’s Largest Rice Producer

### What happened?

- With nominal GDP of around **USD 4.18 trillion**, India has overtaken **Japan** to become  
  the **world’s 4th-largest economy** (after the US, China and Germany).  
- In 2024–25, India’s rice output (~**150.18 million tonnes**) exceeded China’s (~**145.28 million tonnes**),  
  making India the **largest rice producer** globally.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Economic size influences **credit demand, infra spending, corporate capex and consumption** – key for banking sector growth.  
- Agriculture output impacts **agri lending, KCC, warehouse receipt finance and food inflation**.  
- Rice exports are important for **FX earnings and current account balance**, linking to external sector questions.  

### Memory Trick – “4th in GDP, 1st in Rice”

> One line: **“4th in GDP, 1st in Rice – India’s growth and grain both look nice.”**

---

### TOPIC 4: RBI Trend &amp; Progress Report – GNPA Baseline 1.9%

### What happened?

- RBI released its annual **“Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2024–25”**.  
- It projects that the **GNPA ratio of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)**  
  could improve from **2.1% (September 2025)** to around **1.9% by March 2027** in the **baseline scenario**.  
- Under adverse scenarios, some banks might have to dip into their **Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)**.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- NPA metrics and asset quality trends are core **Banking Awareness** topics.  
- A declining GNPA ratio suggests overall system health, but stress pockets (NBFCs, unsecured retail, agri) remain relevant.  
- CCB is a key concept under **Basel‑III capital norms**, often asked in exams.  

### Memory Trick – “21 to 19 – NPAs coming in line”

> Think of 2.1% → 1.9% as **21 → 19** –  
> GNPA is projected to move **down by roughly 0.2 percentage points**.

---

### TOPIC 5: Payments Regulatory Board (PRB) &amp; UPI’s Record Volume

### What happened?

- The **Payments Regulatory Board (PRB)** under RBI held its **first meeting** in Mumbai,  
  replacing the earlier **BPSS** (Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment &amp; Settlement Systems).  
- **UPI** processed an all‑time high of **21.63 billion transactions** in **December 2025**.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- PRB is the central policy body for **UPI, NEFT/RTGS, IMPS, cards, wallets** – critical for banking GA.  
- UPI’s high volumes drive **CASA balances, float income and fee income**, and show deep digital adoption.  
- Fintech‑bank partnerships, payment aggregators and cross‑border UPI are emerging exam themes.  

### Memory Trick – “PRB = Payments RBI Board”

> Just remember: **PRB** is like RBI’s board for **Payments** –  
> **P**ayments **R**egulatory **B**oard.

---

### TOPIC 6: E‑Bill System &amp; Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) – Rabi 2025‑26

### What happened?

- Union Chemicals &amp; Fertilisers Minister **J.P. Nadda** launched an **E‑Bill System**  
  for processing **fertiliser subsidy** claims – making the process **faceless, paperless and cashless**.  
- The Government approved **NBS rates for Rabi 2025‑26**, fixing per‑kg subsidy for **N, P, K, S**,  
  with an estimated subsidy bill of around **₹37,952 crore**.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Faster, transparent subsidy payments can **shorten fertiliser companies’ working capital cycles**,  
  reducing NPA risk for banks financing them.  
- Clear subsidy policy affects **fiscal deficit, G‑Sec yields and banking system liquidity**.  

### Memory Trick – “E‑Bill + NBS = Net Banking Subsidy”

> Imagine fertiliser subsidy being settled like **net banking E‑Bills** –  
> E‑Bill + NBS = think of it as **Net‑style digital subsidy**.

---

### TOPIC 7: Industrial Hemp in Himachal Pradesh – New Rural Credit Segment

### What happened?

- **Himachal Pradesh** notified a policy to allow **industrial hemp cultivation**  
  (non‑narcotic varieties used for fibre, textiles, bio‑composites).  
- The aim is to diversify hill‑area incomes and build a **bio‑economy** around hemp‑based products.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Opens a new segment for **agri‑allied and MSME lending** – processing plants, fibre units, textiles.  
- Policy clarity lowers regulatory risk, making structured project finance possible.  

### Memory Trick – “HEMP = Helping Economy of Mountain People”

> Treat **HEMP** as **Helping Economy of Mountain People** –  
> a cue that it is particularly relevant for Himachal’s rural economy.

---

### TOPIC 8: IAIRO @ GIFT City – AI, Fintech &amp; Reg-Tech Hub

### What happened?

- The Government announced **Indian AI Research Organisation (IAIRO)** at **GIFT City, Gandhinagar (Gujarat)**.  
- It will focus on **AI research** in areas like fintech, reg‑tech, risk modelling and market analytics.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Future banking will rely heavily on **AI‑based credit scoring, fraud detection, AML monitoring** etc.  
- IAIRO strengthens India’s position as an AI hub in financial services.  

### Memory Trick – “IAIRO = India’s AI ‘RO’ plant”

> Like an RO plant filters water, **IAIRO** will “filter data” to produce **AI‑driven solutions** for banks.

---

### TOPIC 9: Dulhasti HEP (Chenab, J&amp;K) &amp; Musi Riverfront (ADB Loan)

### What happened?

- **Dulhasti Stage‑II Hydroelectric Project** on the **Chenab River** in **Kishtwar, J&amp;K**  
  received environmental clearance.  
- **Musi Riverfront Development Project** in **Telangana (Hyderabad region)** got in‑principle loan approval  
  of about **US$500 million** from the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- These are classic cases of **infra &amp; energy projects** – linked to project finance, term lending and infra bonds.  
- ADB funding involves **multilateral lending, sovereign guarantees and external debt** topics.  

### Memory Trick – “Dulhasti–Chenab, Musi–Money”

> Remember: **Dulhasti = Chenab**, **Musi = Money from ADB** –  
> hydro + riverfront both tied to long‑term infra finance.

---

### TOPIC 10: Bulgaria Adopts Euro &amp; EU CBAM – Impact on External Sector

### What happened?

- **Bulgaria** adopted the **Euro (EUR)** as its official currency from **1 January 2026**;  
  its earlier currency was the **Bulgarian Lev (BGN)**.  
- The **European Union** implemented **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**,  
  imposing a carbon‑linked levy on imports of steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, chemicals, glass etc.  

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- Bulgaria’s euro adoption alters its **sovereign risk and currency risk** profile; relevant for external exposure.  
- CBAM may raise costs for Indian exporters to the EU, affecting **trade finance, FX inflows and working capital needs**.  

### Memory Trick – “LEV to EURO, Carbon Levy = CBAM”

> One line: **“LEV left for EURO; EU’s Carbon Levy is CBAM.”**  
> Currency shift + carbon border tax in a single memory hook.
