## TOPIC 1: RBI December 2025 Monetary Policy – Repo at 5.25%

### What happened?

- The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met during **3–5 December 2025** and cut the **repo rate by 25 bps to 5.25%** while keeping the stance broadly **neutral/data‑dependent**.  
- The **MSF rate** was adjusted to around **5.50%**, and the **Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)** was placed at **5.00%**, maintaining the usual corridor.  
- RBI announced **Open Market Operations (OMOs)** for G‑sec purchases totaling about **₹1 lakh crore** in two tranches from mid‑December to inject durable liquidity.  
- A **USD 5 billion buy/sell swap** (around 3‑year tenor) was also announced to fine‑tune rupee liquidity and FX stability.  
- The decision came after headline **CPI inflation had fallen close to 1–2% in late 2025**, well below the 4% target, while real GDP growth for FY26 was still projected near **7.3%**.

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- You must remember the **policy rate level (5.25%)**, the broad **direction (easing)** and **reason (very low inflation)**.  
- OMOs and swaps directly affect **system liquidity, G‑sec yields, cost of funds and loan pricing** – core links for banking awareness.  
- In mains/interviews, this policy is a good example of **“growth‑supporting but inflation‑conscious”** monetary policy.

### Memory Trick – “5–5–5 triangle”

> Visualise a triangle: **Repo 5.25%, SDF 5.00%, MSF 5.50%** –  
> repo in the **middle**, SDF **below**, MSF **above**.

- The **Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR)** reached roughly **93%**, indicating that most legacy bad loans were heavily provided for.  
- Capital positions remained comfortable, with overall **CRAR well above regulatory minima**, and stress tests showed banks could withstand severe macro shocks.

### Why is it important for Bank exams?

- A low GNPA and high PCR mean banks have **room to grow credit**, take calculated risk and support capex.  
- Interviews frequently ask how **IBC, ECL frameworks, better underwriting and recovery** improved bank balance sheets.

### Memory Trick – “2–2–93”

> think of it as **“2–2 bad, 93% covered”**.
