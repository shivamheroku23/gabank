## TOPIC 2: Winter Session 2025 – Insurance & Atomic Energy Reforms

### Kya hua?

- **Winter Session of Parliament** began on **1 December 2025** with a packed reform agenda.  
- Government introduced a major **insurance sector reform Bill** described as a potential “big reset” – streamlining regulation and enabling deeper private participation.  
- The **Atomic Energy Bill, 2025** proposed opening parts of India’s civil nuclear sector to **private/PPP participation**, similar to reforms in the space sector.

### SSC exam points:

- Winter Session 2025: focus on **insurance reforms + atomic energy reforms**.  
- Atomic Energy Bill aims to open **civil nuclear projects** to more private investment (under safeguards).  
- Good linkage with static topics: **IRDAI (insurance regulator)** and **DAE/NPCIL** in nuclear sector.

## TOPIC 3: New Earthquake Risk Map – Himalayas in Highest Zone

### Kya hua?

- A new **seismic zonation map** for India placed the **entire Himalayan arc** (J&K, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Nepal border, NE states) in the **highest‑risk earthquake category**.  
- Map recommends tougher **building codes, retrofitting and land‑use planning** in high‑risk zones.  
- Coastal and peninsular regions remain in lower‑risk zones, but city‑specific micro‑zonation is encouraged.

### SSC exam points:

- Topic fits under **Environment + Disaster management**.  
- Himalayan states = **highest seismic risk** – can be linked with questions on **plate boundaries, faults and disaster policies**.  
- Questions may ask which region is **most earthquake‑prone** or which body releases such maps (BIS/IMD/NDMA context).

**Memory Trick – “Himalaya = High Quake Highway”**

> Imagine the Himalayas as a **“high‑quake highway”** –  
> entire mountain belt marked as **highest risk** in the new seismic map.
