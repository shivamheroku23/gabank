## TOPIC 1: RBI Central Complaints Processing Centre (CRPC) – One National Window for Complaints

### What happened?

- The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has announced the creation of a new **Central Complaints Processing Centre (CRPC)** as part of the revised **RBI Integrated Ombudsman Scheme**.  
- The CRPC will work as a **centralised receipt and processing hub** for all complaints received by email and physical post from customers of regulated entities.  
- Complaints filed online through the **Complaint Management System (CMS) portal – https://cms.rbi.org.in** will continue to be registered directly on the system, while email/post complaints will first be screened at the CRPC.  
- The revised scheme is set to become fully effective from **1 July 2026**, with a single national framework routing complaints to RBI Ombudsman / Deputy Ombudsman.  
- Under the new norms, **compensation up to ₹30 lakh** can be awarded for financial loss, along with additional compensation for harassment, time loss and mental anguish in suitable cases.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme + CRPC framework is central to **customer protection, grievance redressal and financial consumer rights**, all core themes in banking GA.  
- Likely MCQ angles:  
  - CRPC functions under which scheme? → **RBI Integrated Ombudsman Scheme**  
  - Revised scheme’s operational date? → **1 July 2026**  
  - Maximum compensation limit? → **₹30 lakh**  
- In mains and interviews, CRPC is a strong example of **customer‑centric regulation and technology‑enabled grievance handling** by RBI.

## TOPIC 2: SEBI’s New Mutual Fund Rules – Performance-Based Expense Structure from April 2026

### What happened?

- **SEBI** has notified a new **performance-based expense structure** for mutual funds, which will be applicable from **1 April 2026**.  
- Under this framework, each scheme will charge a **Base Expense Ratio (BER)** that covers the basic running cost of the fund, and in addition **performance-linked expenses** may be levied within specified caps.  
- Brokerage, transaction and certain distribution costs will now have **tighter caps and clearer separation**, and all additional expenses must be **disclosed transparently** to investors.  
- Governance norms for asset management companies (AMCs) have been strengthened, with more emphasis on **board oversight, risk management and mis‑selling controls**.  
- The objective is to **align investor costs with fund performance, reduce over‑charging and improve transparency** in the mutual fund industry.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Mutual funds, expense ratios and SEBI regulations are **regular features** in banking and financial awareness sections.  
- Possible MCQ points:  
  - Effective date of new rules? → **1 April 2026**  
  - Regulator? → **SEBI**  
  - Key concept introduced? → **Base Expense Ratio + performance‑linked expense component**  
- In descriptive answers, this reform is a good case study of **investor protection, cost transparency and governance in capital markets**.  

### Memory Trick – “BER = Base cost, performance pay on top”

> Imagine the fund’s bill split into two lines: **“Base” (BER)** + **“Bonus” (performance-linked)** – from **April 2026** this is how MF expenses are structured.

## TOPIC 3: India’s Forex Reserves – USD 392 Million Rise to Around USD 687.19 Billion

### What happened?

- As per RBI’s weekly data for mid‑January 2026, **India’s foreign exchange reserves** increased by about **USD 392 million**.  
- Total reserves climbed to nearly **USD 687.19 billion**, providing a strong external buffer for the economy.  
- Within this, **Foreign Currency Assets (FCA)** saw a marginal decline, but a **sharp increase in gold reserves** more than offset this fall.  
- Holdings of **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)** and **India’s reserve position with the IMF** moved slightly lower, but the overall foreign exchange position remains comfortable.  
- High reserves support **import cover, rupee stability, sovereign rating comfort and investor confidence**, especially during global volatility.

### Why is this important for bank exams?

- Forex reserves, their **components (FCA, gold, SDR, IMF position)** and levels are standard topics in **RBI & economy awareness**.  
- Typical questions:  
  - Approximate level of reserves (range based).  
  - What FCA stands for → **Foreign Currency Assets**.  
  - Which items form part of official reserves.  
- In mains, this data strengthens answers on **external sector stability, balance of payments and rupee management**.  

### Memory Trick – “6‑8‑7 = safety shield”

> Remember the ballpark number **USD 687 billion** as **“6‑8‑7”** – think of **a shield labelled 6‑8‑7 protecting India from external shocks**.
