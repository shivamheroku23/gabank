## TOPIC 1: Payments Regulatory Board (PRB)

  **BPSS – Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems**.  
- On **5 January 2026**, PRB held its **first meeting** in Mumbai:  
  - chaired by the RBI Governor,  
  - reviewed the work of RBI’s **Department of Payment &amp; Settlement Systems (DPSS)**,  
  - assessed running payment schemes (UPI, NEFT/RTGS, card networks, PPIs) and risk areas,  
  - discussed the draft **“Payments Vision 2028”**,  
  - examined key findings from RBI’s **Survey on Digital Payments**.  

### SSC exam points

## TOPIC 2: Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) – Rabi 2025‑26

- For **Rabi 2025‑26 (Oct–Mar)**, the government approved  
  **Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)** rates for P&amp;K fertilisers:  
  - N – ₹43.02/kg, P – ₹47.96/kg, K – ₹2.38/kg, S – ₹2.87/kg.  
- The scheme (in place since 2010) gives subsidy to fertiliser companies  
  based on the nutrient content of their products.  

### SSC exam points

- NBS is for which fertilisers? → **Phosphatic &amp; Potassic (P&amp;K) fertilisers**.  
- Aim – **balanced fertiliser use**, reduce over‑reliance on urea.  

**Memory Trick – “NBS = Nutrient Budgeting System”**

> NBS = the government’s **Nutrient Budgeting System** –  
> a fixed budget per kg of N, P, K, S.

## TOPIC 3: ONGC–NSTFDC CSR MoU – EMRS Support

- **ONGC** signed a CSR MoU with  
  **NSTFDC (National Scheduled Tribes Finance &amp; Development Corporation)**  
  worth about **₹28 crore**:  
  - for **144 Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)** in 11 States/UTs,  
  - to improve infrastructure and digital facilities (classrooms, labs, equipment).  

### SSC exam points

- NSTFDC – PSU under **Ministry of Tribal Affairs**; works for ST economic development.  
- EMRS – residential school system for tribal students.

> in **EMRS schools** through NSTFDC.

## TOPIC 4: FTA Trade Deficit &amp; Forex Reserves

- NITI Aayog’s **Trade Watch** report states that in  
  **April–June 2025**, India’s trade deficit with **FTA partner countries**  
  increased by about **59% year‑on‑year**.  
- RBI data show that in the week ended **26 Dec 2025**,  
  forex reserves increased by about **US$ 3.3 bn**.  

### SSC exam points

- Trade deficit = when imports (value) exceed exports.  
- Forex reserves are managed by the **RBI**.  

**Memory Trick – “FTA gate, deficit comes late”**

> Free trade agreements open the gate;  
> if exports lag, **deficit** walks in.
