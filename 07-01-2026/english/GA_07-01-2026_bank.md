## TOPIC 1: PRB – New Payments Governance Framework

### What happened?

- In 2025, Parliament amended the **Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007**  
  to create a new body inside RBI called the **Payments Regulatory Board (PRB)**.  
- The amendment became effective on **9 May 2025**, and PRB formally replaced the earlier body  
  **BPSS – Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems**.  
- Later, on **5 January 2026**, PRB held its **first meeting** in Mumbai:  
  - chaired by RBI Governor **Sanjay Malhotra**,  
  - the Board reviewed the responsibilities, ongoing projects and risk areas of RBI’s  
    **Department of Payment &amp; Settlement Systems (DPSS)**,  
  - presentations were made on domestic and global payment‑system trends  
    (UPI, card networks, cross‑border systems), competition and cyber‑risk,  
  - members discussed RBI’s draft **Payments Vision 2028**, especially  
    financial inclusion, fraud‑management and cross‑border UPI,  
  - findings from RBI’s **Survey on Digital Payments** were shared  
    to ensure future policy is data‑driven.

### Why important for bank exams?

- PRB is now the **main regulator/supervisor of India’s payment systems** –  
  UPI, cards, NEFT/RTGS, PPIs all come under its umbrella.  
- MCQ focus points:  
  - Which Act? → **Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (amended)**.  
  - Which body was replaced? → **BPSS**.  
  - Who chairs PRB? → **RBI Governor**.

### Memory Trick – “PRB remote + Vision 2028 screen”

> Imagine **PRB as the remote** and **Payments Vision 2028 as the TV screen** –  
> together they control and display the full picture of India’s payment systems.

## TOPIC 2: NBS – Rabi 2025‑26 (Subsidy Structure)

### What happened?

- For the **Rabi 2025‑26 season (1 Oct 2025 – 31 Mar 2026)** the government  
  approved new **Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)** rates on **Phosphatic &amp; Potassic (P&amp;K) fertilisers**  
  (based on the official notification/PIB summary):  
  - **Nitrogen (N): ₹43.02/kg**  
  - **Phosphorus (P): ₹47.96/kg**  
  - **Potassium (K): ₹2.38/kg**  
  - **Sulphur (S): ₹2.87/kg**  
- The scheme has been running since 2010 – fertiliser companies receive subsidy  
  according to the nutrients (N, P, K, S) contained in their products,  
  so that farmers get reasonable retail prices.  
- Estimated subsidy bill for Rabi 2025‑26 is about **₹37,952 crore**,  
  around **₹736 crore** higher than Kharif 2025 –  
  indicating the government does not want to pass on global fertiliser price pressure to farmers.

### Bank/economy angle

- Fertiliser companies’ subsidy receivables and working‑capital needs  
  are largely financed by **PSBs and large private banks**.  
- Such a large subsidy bill affects **fiscal deficit** and inflation expectations,  
  making it directly relevant in macro‑economy questions.

### Memory Trick – “NBS = RATE card for N‑P‑K‑S”

> Think of **NBS** as the government’s **RATE card** for N‑P‑K‑S –  
> how many rupees per kg support each nutrient gets.

## TOPIC 3: ONGC–NSTFDC Model – Tribal CSR &amp; Education

### What happened?

- **Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)** signed a **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) MoU**  
  with the **National Scheduled Tribes Finance &amp; Development Corporation (NSTFDC)**.  
- Under this MoU, ONGC will provide about **₹28 crore** in CSR funds to:  
  - upgrade infrastructure in around **144 Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)**  
    across **11 States/UTs**, including classrooms, hostels, computer labs,  
    smart‑class equipment, solar power and internet connectivity.  
- The aim is to give around **35,000 tribal students** better residential education facilities,  
  helping them prepare for higher education and competitive exams.

### Why important for bank exams?

- This is a good example of **large PSUs using CSR spending**  
  to support **education + inclusion** – excellent for mains answers/case studies.  
- Educated youth from tribal areas become future **MSME borrowers, SHG members, agri‑entrepreneurs**,  
  creating new markets for banks.

### Memory Trick – “ONGC oil, EMRS education”

> ONGC earns from **oil**, and CSR funds go into **EMRS schools’ study + sports** –  
> a clean link between natural‑resource profits and human‑capital building.

## TOPIC 4: Trade Deficit with FTA Partners &amp; Forex Reserves

### What happened?

- According to NITI Aayog’s **Trade Watch** report,  
  in the **April–June 2025 quarter**, India’s trade deficit  
  with countries having **Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)**  
  increased by about **59% year‑on‑year**:  
  - imports in sectors like electronics, chemicals, high‑value intermediates rose sharply,  
  - while export growth lagged.  
- Around the same period, RBI data show that  
  in the week ended **26 Dec 2025**, India’s **forex reserves**  
  **increased by about US$ 3.3 billion** –  
  indicating that external buffers remained strong.

### Bank/economy angle

- FTA‑driven trade deficits put pressure on the **Current Account Deficit (CAD)**,  
  affecting the rupee, bond yields and foreign investor sentiment.  
- Rising forex reserves help absorb part of this pressure,  
  so both indicators must be viewed together.

### Memory Trick – “FTA opens gate, deficit &amp; reserves debate”

> The FTA **opens the gate**, imports surge and the **deficit** rises –  
> but growing **forex reserves** help protect the rupee in this debate.

## TOPIC 5: Payments Vision 2028 – 4S Payments

### What happened?

- RBI released a draft policy document **“Payments Vision 2028”**,  
  setting the roadmap for India’s digital payments ecosystem for 2025–2028.  
- Key goals:  
  - provide every user with **Safe, Secure, Smart, Swift** payment experiences,  
  - ensure **24×7, low‑cost, fast** digital instruments  
    (UPI, RuPay, IMPS, NEFT/RTGS, offline solutions),  
  - strengthen **fraud management and cyber‑security**,  
  - expand feature‑phone/offline UPI options in smaller towns and villages,  
  - make **cross‑border remittances** cheaper and faster,  
  - clarify payment‑data governance (consent, privacy, data‑localisation).

### Why important for bank exams?

- UPI, RuPay, NEFT/RTGS, BBPS, digital rupee –  
  their future direction is guided by this document.  
- In mains/interviews, questions can be:  
  - “What are the main pillars of Payments Vision 2028?”  
  - “How does it support financial inclusion?”

### Memory Trick – “4S formula”

> Payments Vision 2028 = **4S** –  
> **Safe, Secure, Smart, Swift** payments for all users.
