## TOPIC 1: Canara Bank + NBSL – UPI via BHIM Plug‑in on Canara ai1Pe

- NBSL is a **wholly‑owned subsidiary of NPCI** (formed in June 2024) and manages the **BHIM app**, originally launched in 2016 by the Prime Minister.  
- The plug‑in approach improves **security, resilience and scalability**, while allowing banks to focus on **core banking** and rely on NBSL for UPI technology upgrades.

## TOPIC 3: OECD Global Minimum Corporate Tax Deal

### What happened?

- The **Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD)** has finalised a **global minimum corporate tax agreement** with the **United States and over 100 countries**.  
- The deal effectively provides a **carve‑out** that exempts many **US‑based multinationals** from the 15% global minimum tax, in exchange for other countries **not imposing extra top‑up taxes** on their foreign subsidiaries.  
- The original idea of a **15% global minimum tax** was to curb **profit shifting and tax avoidance** by large MNCs using low‑tax jurisdictions.  
- Under the compromise, US argues that its **domestic minimum corporate tax** and existing international tax rules already meet the spirit of the agreement.
