## TOPIC 1: PMFBY &amp; Weather‑Based Crop Insurance – Extension/Reforms

### What happened?

- The Union Cabinet decided to **continue**  
  **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)** and  
  **Weather‑Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS)** for upcoming seasons,  
  with operational improvements.  
- Key focus areas:  
  - using **SMART‑tech** (remote sensing, drones, satellites) to reduce crop‑cutting experiments,  
  - speeding up claim settlement,  
  - strengthening grievance redressal.  

### Why important for bank exams?

- In PMFBY, **banks play the nodal role**:  
  - debiting premiums linked to crop loans,  
  - routing claims into farmer accounts.  
- In PSL (Priority Sector Lending), **agri insurance** is an important cross‑link with farm credit risk.  

### Memory Trick – “Crop risk covered by PMFBY, money flows via banks”

> Line: **“Crop ka risk PMFBY,  
> claim ka paisa bank ke through entry.”**

## TOPIC 3: New Crop Varieties &amp; Agri Research – ICAR’s Role

### What happened?

- ICAR and State agricultural universities released  
  new **high‑yielding and climate‑resilient crop varieties** for the 2025‑26 season:  
  - drought‑tolerant rice/wheat,  
  - pest‑resistant pulses,  
  - improved horticulture and oilseed varieties.  

### Why important for bank exams?

- Better varieties → higher yields →  
  improved **repayment capacity of farmers** →  
  potential reduction in agri NPAs.  
- KCC, agri‑term loans, Agri Infra Fund – all depend on such productivity improvements.  

### Memory Trick – “Better seed = lower NPA risk”

> Simple line: **“Achha seed, lower risk – bank profit build.”**

  - **Jan Dhan accounts**,

  - Aadhaar seeding – all are central themes in banking exams.  

### Memory Trick – “DBT = Direct Bank Transfer”
