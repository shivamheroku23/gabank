## TOPIC 1: SOAR – Skilling for AI Readiness (for Banking/Fintech)

### What happened?

- On **1 January 2026**, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan Cultural Centre (New Delhi),  
  President **Droupadi Murmu** launched several initiatives under  
  **SOAR – Skilling for AI Readiness** (as per PIB releases).  
- Nodal ministry: **Ministry of Skill Development &amp; Entrepreneurship (MSDE)** under the Skill India Mission.  
- Key elements:  
  - **“Skill the Nation Challenge”** – an AI awareness and skilling campaign,  
  - beginner‑level AI and data‑science modules,  
  - inauguration of an IGNOU Regional Centre and Skill Centre at Rairangpur (Odisha).

### Why important for bank exams?

- Banks/NBFCs/fintechs increasingly need professionals trained in **AI, ML and Data Analytics** for:  
  - fraud detection,  
  - credit scoring,  
  - chatbots and customer support,  
  - risk modelling and RegTech.  
- SOAR will gradually expand the talent pool that powers **digital banking and fintech ecosystems**.

### Memory Trick – “SOAR = Skill Our AI Resources”

> SOAR = **Skill Our AI Resources** –

## TOPIC 2: Integrated e‑Bill System – For Fertiliser Subsidies

### What happened?

- On **1 January 2026**, at Kartavya Bhawan, New Delhi,  
  Union Minister **J.P. Nadda** (Chemicals &amp; Fertilisers) launched the  
  **Integrated e‑Bill System for Fertiliser Subsidies**.  
- Around **₹2 lakh crore** of annual fertiliser subsidy will now be processed  
  through an **end‑to‑end digital workflow**.  
- Main features:  
  - companies submit bills/claims **online**,  
  - department’s **iFMS** system is integrated with **PFMS**,  
  - **FIFO** processing, real‑time tracking,  
  - digital audit trail, reduced fraud and delays.

### Why important for bank exams?

- Subsidy flows to fertiliser companies largely move **through banks**.  
- With e‑Bills:  
  - reconciliation is easier,  
  - **working‑capital risk** is lower,  
  - clarity on subsidy receivables improves cash‑flow planning for companies and banks.

### Memory Trick – “Fertiliser bills go e‑Bill”

> Earlier, fertiliser subsidy bills moved as paper files;  
> now think: **“Even fertiliser bills have gone FinTech”** – via integrated e‑Bills.

## TOPIC 3: Sin Goods – Health &amp; National Security Cess

### What happened?

- The government has decided that on **“sin goods”** like tobacco, pan masala and gutkha:  
  - the existing **GST Compensation Cess** will be gradually replaced by  
  - **Additional Excise Duty + Health &amp; National Security Cess** (effective 2026, based on Finance Ministry notifications).  
- The base GST rates (around 40% for cigarettes/pan masala, ~18% for bidis) remain broadly unchanged;  
  the new Cess is an **additional levy** on top of existing taxes.

### Why important for bank exams?

- Indirect tax structure and the idea of **“sin tax”** are favourite areas in Economy/GST MCQs.  
- The name **Health &amp; National Security Cess** highlights where the extra revenue is meant to go:  
  - towards health‑related costs and  
  - national‑security related expenditure.

### Memory Trick – “Old CC → new HN”

> Earlier: **CC – Compensation Cess**,  
> Now: **HN – Health &amp; National (Security) Cess**.  
> Line: **“CC went, HN came – extra load on sin goods’ name.”**

## TOPIC 4: Land Stack (DILRMP) – Digital Support for Secured Lending

### What happened?

- Under the **Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP)**,  
  the government has launched a digital land‑records platform called **“Land Stack”**  
  (piloted in **Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu**).  
- Land Stack:  
  - integrates **land records, cadastral maps, ownership details and encumbrances** on one platform,  
  - exposes APIs for banks and financial institutions to access **verified land information**.

### Why important for bank exams?

- In collateral‑based lending (housing, agriculture, mortgage):  
  - the biggest risk is wrong title, double mortgage, or benami property.  
- With Land Stack:  
  - title and encumbrance verification becomes easier,  
  - chances of **fraud and NPAs** from faulty collateral go down,  
  - effectively acts like **“Digital Land KYC”** for secured lending.

### Memory Trick – “Land Stack = Digital land folder”

> Imagine every plot of land has a **single digital folder** –  
> that is Land Stack, helping banks lend more safely.

## TOPIC 5: RBI Stress Tests &amp; Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)

### What happened?

- RBI’s **Financial Stability Report (FSR)** states that:  
  - in a **moderate stress** scenario, a few scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)  
    may need to dip into their **Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)**,  
  - in a **severe stress** scenario, more banks may require fresh capital.  
- At the system level, capital adequacy remains **comfortable**,  
  but caution is advised for high‑risk NBFCs and sector‑specific exposures.

### Why important for bank exams?

- CCB is a key element of the **Basel‑III capital framework**:  
  - an additional capital layer of about **2.5% of Risk‑Weighted Assets (RWA)**.  
- Typical exam question:  
  - “What is the purpose of the Capital Conservation Buffer?” →  
    **to provide an extra capital cushion to absorb losses during periods of stress.**

### Memory Trick – “CCB = Cushion Capital Buffer”

> Think of CCB as a **Cushion Capital Buffer** –  
> when the economy hits turbulence, this cushion helps banks absorb the shock.
